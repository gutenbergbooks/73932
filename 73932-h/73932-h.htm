</div>


<p>Fear, rage and pain, and the pangs of hunger are all
primitive experiences which human beings share with
the lower animals. These experiences are properly classed
as among the most powerful that determine the action
of men and beasts. A knowledge of the conditions
which attend these experiences, therefore, is of general
and fundamental importance in the interpretation of
behavior.</p>

<p>During the past four years there has been conducted,
in the Harvard Physiological Laboratory, a series of investigations
concerned with the bodily changes which
occur in conjunction with pain, hunger and the major
emotions. A group of remarkable alterations in the
bodily economy have been discovered, all of which can
reasonably be regarded as responses that are nicely
adapted to the individual’s welfare and preservation.
Because these physiological adaptations are interesting
both in themselves and in their interpretation, not only
to physiologists and psychologists, but to others as well,
it has seemed worth while to gather together in convenient
form the original accounts of the experiments,
which have been published in various American medical
and physiological journals. I have, however, attempted
to arrange the results and discussions in an orderly
and consecutive manner, and I have tried also to eliminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p. viii]</span>
or incidentally to explain the technical terms, so
that the exposition will be easily understood by any
intelligent reader even though not trained in the medical
sciences.</p>

<p>My first interest in the conditions attending pain,
hunger and strong emotional states was stimulated during
the course of a previous series of researches on the
motor activities of the alimentary canal. A summary
of these researches appeared in 1911, under the title,
“The Mechanical Factors of Digestion.” The studies
recorded in the present volume may be regarded as a
natural sequence of observations on the influence of
emotional states on the digestive process, which were
reported in that volume.</p>

<p class="center">THE EFFECT OF THE EMOTIONS ON
DIGESTION</p>


<p class="sp2">The doctrine of human development from subhuman
antecedents has done much to unravel the
complex nature of man. As a means of interpretation
this doctrine has been directed chiefly
toward the solving of puzzles in the peculiarities
of anatomical structure. Thus arrangements in
the human body, which are without obvious utility,
receive rational explanation as being vestiges
of parts useful in or characteristic of remote ancestors&mdash;parts
retained in man because of age-long
racial inheritance. This mode of interpretation
has proved applicable also in accounting for
functional peculiarities. Expressive actions and
gestures&mdash;the facial appearance in anger, for example&mdash;observed
in children and in widely distinct
races, are found to be innate, and are best
explained as the retention in human beings of
responses which are similar in character in lower
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span></p>

<p>From this point of view biology has contributed
much to clarify our ideas regarding the motives
of human behavior. The social philosophies
which prevailed during the past century either
assumed that conduct was determined by a calculated
search for pleasure and avoidance of pain
or they ascribed it to a vague and undefined
faculty named the conscience or the moral sense.
Comparative study of the behavior of men and
of lower animals under various circumstances,
however, especially with the purpose of learning
the source of prevailing impulses, is revealing the
inadequacy of the theories of the older psychologists.
More and more it is appearing that in
men of all races and in most of the higher animals,
the springs of action are to be found in
the influence of certain emotions which express
themselves in characteristic instinctive acts.</p>

<p>The rôle which these fundamental responses in
the higher organisms play in the bodily economy
has received little attention. As a realm for investigation
the bodily changes in emotional excitement
have been left by the physiologists to
the philosophers and psychologists and to the
students of natural history. These students, however,
have usually had too slight experience in
the detailed examination of bodily functions to
permit them to follow the clues which superficial
observation might present. In consequence our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
knowledge of emotional states has been meager.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many surface manifestations
of excitement. The contraction of blood
vessels with resulting pallor, the pouring out of
“cold sweat,” the stopping of saliva-flow so that
the “tongue cleaves to the roof of the mouth,” the
dilation of the pupils, the rising of the hairs, the
rapid beating of the heart, the hurried respiration,
the trembling and twitching of the muscles,
especially those about the lips&mdash;all these bodily
changes are well recognized accompaniments of
pain and great emotional disturbance, such as
fear, horror and deep disgust. But these disturbances
of the even routine of life, which have
been commonly noted, are mainly superficial and
therefore readily observable. Even the increased
rapidity of the heart beat is noted at the surface
in the pulsing of the arteries. There are, however,
other organs, hidden deep in the body,
which do not reveal so obviously as the structures
near or in the skin, the disturbances of
action which attend states of intense feeling.
Special methods must be used to determine
whether these deep-lying organs also are included
in the complex of an <span class="nowrap">emotional<a id="SNanchor_1" href="#Starnote_1" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> agitation.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_1" href="#SNanchor_1" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>In the use of the term “emotion” the meaning here is
not restricted to violent affective states, but includes “feelings”
and other affective experiences. At times, also, in
order to avoid awkward expressions, the term is used in the
popular manner, as if the “feeling” caused the bodily change.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span></p>

<p>Among the organs that are affected to an important
degree by feelings are those concerned
with digestion. And the relations of feelings to
the activities of the alimentary canal are of particular
interest, because recent investigations have
shown that not only are the first stages of the
digestive process normally started by the pleasurable
taste and smell and sight of food, but also
that pain and great emotional excitement can
seriously interfere with the starting of the process
or its continuation after it has been started.
Thus there may be a conflict of feelings and of
their bodily accompaniments&mdash;a conflict the interesting
bearing of which we shall consider later.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emotions Favorable to Normal Secretion of the
Digestive Juices</span></h3>

<p>The feelings or affective states favorable to
the digestive functions have been studied fruitfully
by <span class="nowrap">Pawlow,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> of Petrograd, through ingenious
experiments on dogs. By the use of careful
surgical methods he was able to make a side
pouch of a part of the stomach, the cavity of
which was wholly separate from the main cavity
in which the food was received. This pouch was
supplied in a normal manner with nerves and
blood vessels, and as it opened to the surface of
the body, the amount and character of the gastric
juice secreted by it under various conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>
could be accurately determined. Secretion by that
part of the stomach wall which was included in
the pouch was representative of the secretory
activities of the entire stomach. The arrangement
was particularly advantageous in providing
the gastric juice unmixed with food. In some of
the animals thus operated upon an opening was
also made in the esophagus so that when the
food was swallowed, it did not pass to the stomach
but dropped out on the way. All the pleasures
of eating were thus experienced, and there
was no necessity of stopping because of a sense
of fulness. This process was called “sham feeding.”
The well-being of these animals was carefully
attended to, they lived the normal life of
dogs, and in the course of months and years became
the pets of the laboratory.</p>

<p>By means of sham feeding Pawlow showed that
the chewing and swallowing of food which the
dogs relished resulted, after a delay of about five
minutes, in a flow of natural gastric juice from
the side pouch of the stomach&mdash;a flow which persisted
as long as the dog chewed and swallowed
the food, and continued for some time after eating
ceased. Evidently the presence of food in
the stomach is not a prime condition for gastric
secretion. And since the flow occurred only when
the dogs had an appetite, and the material presented
to them was agreeable, the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>
was justified that this was a true psychic
secretion.</p>

<p>The mere sight or smell of a favorite food may
start the pouring out of gastric juice, as was
noted many years ago by Bidder and <span class="nowrap">Schmidt<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
in a hungry dog which had a fistulous opening
through the body wall into the stomach. This
observation, reported in 1852, was confirmed later
by Schiff and also still later by Pawlow. That
the mouth “waters” with a flow of saliva when
palatable food is seen or smelled has long been
such common knowledge that the expression, “It
makes my mouth water,” is at once recognized as
the highest testimony to the attractiveness of an
appetizing dish. That the stomach also “waters”
in preparation for digesting the food which is to
be taken is clearly proved by the above cited observations
on the dog.</p>

<p>The importance of the initial psychic secretion
of saliva for further digestion is indicated when,
in estimating the function of taste for the pleasures
of appetite, we realize that materials can
be tasted only when dissolved in the mouth and
thereby brought into relation with the taste organs.
The saliva which “waters” the mouth assures
the dissolving of dry but soluble food even
when it is taken in large amount.</p>

<p>The importance of the initial psychic secretion
of gastric juice is made clear by the fact that continuance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span>
of the flow of this juice during digestion
is provided by the action of its acid or its
digestive products on the mucous membrane of
the pyloric end of the stomach, and that secretion
of the pancreatic juice and bile are called
forth by the action of this same acid on the mucous
membrane of the duodenum. The proper
starting of the digestive process, therefore, is
conditioned by the satisfactions of the palate, and
the consequent flow of the first digestive fluids.</p>

<p>The facts brought out experimentally in studies
on lower animals are doubtless true also of man.
Not very infrequently, because of the accidental
swallowing of corrosive substances, the esophagus
is so injured that, when it heals, the sides
grow together and the tube is closed. Under
these circumstances an opening has to be made
into the stomach through the side of the body and
then the individual chews his food in the usual
manner, but ejects it from his mouth into a tube
which is passed through the gastric opening. The
food thus goes from mouth to stomach through
a tube outside the chest instead of inside the
chest. As long ago as 1878, <span class="nowrap">Richet,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> who had
occasion to study a girl whose esophagus was
closed and who was fed through a gastric fistula,
reported that whenever the girl chewed or tasted
a highly sapid substance, such as sugar or lemon
juice, while the stomach was empty, there flowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>
from the fistula a considerable quantity of gastric
juice. A number of later observers<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> have had
similar cases in human beings, especially in children,
and have reported in detail results which
correspond remarkably with those obtained in the
laboratory. Hornborg<a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> found that when the
little boy whom he studied chewed agreeable food
a more or less active secretion of gastric juice
invariably started, whereas the chewing of an
indifferent substance, as gutta-percha, was followed
by no secretion. All these observations
clearly demonstrate that the normal flow of the
first digestive fluids, the saliva and the gastric
juice, is favored by the pleasurable feelings
which accompany the taste and smell of food during
mastication, or which are roused in anticipation
of eating when choice morsels are seen or
smelled.</p>

<p>These facts are of fundamental importance in
the serving of food, especially when, through illness,
the appetite is fickle. The degree of daintiness
with which nourishment is served, the little
attentions to esthetic details&mdash;the arrangement
of the dishes, the small portions of food, the
flower beside the plate&mdash;all may help to render
food pleasing to the eye and savory to the nostrils
and may be the deciding factors in determining
whether the restoration of strength is to begin
or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emotions Unfavorable to the Normal Secretion of the
Digestive Juices</span></h3>

<p>The conditions favorable to proper digestion
are wholly abolished when unpleasant feelings
such as vexation and worry and anxiety, or great
emotions such as anger and fear, are allowed to
prevail. This fact, so far as the salivary secretion
is concerned, has long been known. The
dry mouth of the anxious person called upon to
speak in public is a common instance; and the
“ordeal of rice,” as employed in India, was a practical
utilization of the knowledge that excitement
is capable of inhibiting the salivary flow. When
several persons were suspected of crime, the consecrated
rice was given to them all to chew, and
after a short time it was spit out upon the leaf of
the sacred fig tree. If anyone ejected it dry, that
was taken as proof that fear of being discovered
had stopped the secretion, and consequently he
was adjudged <span class="nowrap">guilty.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>What has long been recognized as true of the
secretion of saliva has been proved true also of
the secretion of gastric juice. For example,
Hornborg was unable to confirm in his little patient
with a gastric fistula the observation by
Pawlow that when hunger is present the mere
seeing of food results in a flow of gastric juice.
Hornborg explained the difference between his
and Pawlow’s results by the different ways in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span>
which the boy and the dogs faced the situation.
When food was shown, but withheld, the hungry
dogs were all eagerness to secure it, and the juice
very soon began to flow. The boy, on the contrary,
became vexed when he could not eat at
once, and began to cry; then no secretion appeared.
Bogen also has reported the instance of
a child with closed esophagus and gastric fistula,
who sometimes fell into such a passion in consequence
of vain hoping for food that the giving
of the food, after the child was calmed, was not
followed by any flow of the secretion.</p>

<p>The inhibitory influence of excitement has also
been seen in lower animals under laboratory conditions.
Le <span class="nowrap">Conte<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> declares that in studying
gastric secretion it is necessary to avoid all circumstances
likely to provoke emotional reactions.
In the fear which dogs manifest when first
brought into strange surroundings he found that
activity of the gastric glands may be completely
suppressed. The suppression occurred even if
the dog had eaten freely and was then disturbed&mdash;as,
for example, by being tied to a table. When
the animals became accustomed to the experimental
procedure, it no longer had an inhibitory
effect. The studies of Bickel and <span class="nowrap">Sasaki<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> confirm
and define more precisely this inhibitory
effect of strong emotion on gastric secretion.
They observed the inhibition on a dog with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>
esophageal fistula, and with a side pouch of the
stomach, which, as in Pawlow’s experiments,
opened only to the exterior. In this dog Bickel
and Sasaki noted, as Pawlow had, that sham feeding
was attended by a copious flow of gastric
juice, a true psychic secretion, resulting from the
pleasurable taste of the food. In a typical instance
the sham feeding lasted five minutes, and
the secretion continued for twenty minutes, during
which time 66.7 cubic centimeters of pure gastric
juice were produced.</p>

<p>On another day a cat was brought into the
presence of the dog, whereupon the dog flew into
a great fury. The cat was soon removed, and
the dog pacified. Now the dog was again given
the sham feeding for five minutes. In spite of
the fact that the animal was hungry and ate
eagerly, there was no secretion worthy of mention.
During a period of twenty minutes, corresponding
to the previous observation, only 9
cubic centimeters of acid fluid were produced, and
this was rich in mucus. It is evident that in the
dog, as in the boy observed by Bogen, strong emotions
can so profoundly disarrange the mechanisms
of secretion that the pleasurable excitation which
accompanies the taking of food cannot cause the
normal flow.</p>

<p>On another occasion Bickel and Sasaki started
gastric secretion in the dog by sham feeding, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>
when the flow of gastric juice had reached a certain
height, the dog was infuriated for five minutes
by the presence of the cat. During the next
fifteen minutes there appeared only a few drops
of a very mucous secretion. Evidently in this
instance a physiological process, started as an
accompaniment of a psychic state quietly pleasurable
in character, was almost entirely stopped
after another psychic state violent in character.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in both the favorable and
unfavorable results of the emotional excitement
illustrated in Bickel and Sasaki’s dog the effects
persisted long after the removal of the exciting
condition. This fact, in its favorable aspect,
<span class="nowrap">Bickel<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> was able to confirm in a girl with
esophageal and gastric fistulas; the gastric secretion
long outlasted the period of eating, although
no food entered the stomach. The influences
unfavorable to digestion, however, are
stronger than those which promote it. And
evidently, if the digestive process, because of
emotional disturbance, is for some time inhibited,
the swallowing of food which must lie stagnant in
the stomach is a most irrational procedure. If a
child has experienced an outburst of passion, it
is well not to urge the taking of nourishment soon
afterwards. Macbeth’s advice that “good digestion
wait on appetite and health on both,” is now
well-founded physiology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span></p>

<p>Other digestive glands than the salivary and
the gastric may be checked in emotional excitement.
Recently <span class="nowrap">Oechsler<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> has reported that in
such psychic disturbances as were shown by
Bickel and Sasaki to be accompanied by suppressed
secretion of the gastric juice, the secretion
of pancreatic juice may be stopped, and the
flow of bile definitely checked. All the means of
bringing about chemical changes in the food may
be thus temporarily abolished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emotions Favorable and Unfavorable to the Contractions
of the Stomach and Intestines</span></h3>

<p>The secretions of the digestive glands and the
chemical changes wrought by them are of little
worth unless the food is carried onward through
the alimentary canal into fresh regions of digestion
and is thoroughly exposed to the intestinal
wall for absorption. In studying these mechanical
aspects of digestion I was led to <span class="nowrap">infer<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> that
just as there is a psychic secretion, so likewise
there is probably a “psychic tone” or “psychic
contraction” of the gastro-intestinal muscles
as a result of taking food. For if the vagus nerve
supply to the stomach is cut immediately <em>before</em>
an animal takes food, the usual contractions of
the gastric wall, as seen by the Röntgen rays, do
not occur; but if these nerves are cut <em>after</em> food
has been eaten with relish, the contractions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>
have started continue without cessation. The
nerves in both conditions were severed under
anesthesia, so that no element of pain entered
into the experiments. In the absence of hunger,
which in itself provides a contracted <span class="nowrap">stomach,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
the pleasurable taking of food may, therefore, be
a primary condition for the appearance of natural
contractions of the gastro-intestinal canal.</p>

<p>Again just as the secretory activities of the
stomach are unfavorably influenced by strong
emotions, so also are the movements of the stomach;
and, indeed, the movements of almost the
entire alimentary canal are wholly stopped during
great excitement. In my earliest observations
on the movements of the <span class="nowrap">stomach<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> I had
difficulty because in some animals the waves of
contraction were perfectly evident, while in others
there was no sign of activity. Several weeks
passed before I discovered that this difference
was associated with a difference of sex. In order
to be observed with Röntgen rays the animals
were restrained in a holder. Although the holder
was comfortable, the male cats, particularly the
young males, were restive and excited on being
fastened to it, and under these circumstances
gastric peristaltic waves were absent; the female
cats, especially if elderly, usually submitted with
calmness to the restraint, and in them the waves
had their normal occurrence. Once a female with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>
kittens turned from her state of quiet contentment
to one of apparent restless anxiety. The
movements of the stomach immediately stopped,
the gastric wall became wholly relaxed, and only
after the animal had been petted and began to
purr did the moving waves start again on their
course. By covering the cat’s mouth and nose
with the fingers until a slight distress of breathing
is produced, the stomach contractions can be
stopped at will. In the cat, therefore, any sign
of rage or fear, such as was seen in dogs by Le
Conte and by Bickel and Sasaki, was accompanied
by a total abolition of the movements of the
stomach. Even indications of slight anxiety may
be attended by complete absence of the churning
waves. In a vigorous young male cat I have
watched the stomach for more than an hour by
means of the Röntgen rays, and during that time
not the slightest beginning of peristaltic activity
appeared; yet the only visible indication of excitement
in the animal was a continued quick
twitching of the tail to and fro. What is true
of the cat I have found true also of the rabbit,
dog and <span class="nowrap">guinea-pig<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>&mdash;very mild emotional disturbances
are attended by abolition of peristalsis.
The observations on the rabbit have been confirmed
by <span class="nowrap">Auer,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> who found that the handling
of the animal incidental to fastening it gently
to a holder stopped gastric peristalsis for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span>
variable length of time. And if the animal was
startled for any reason, or struggled excitedly,
peristalsis was again abolished. The observations
on the dog also have been confirmed; <span class="nowrap">Lommel<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
found that small dogs in strange surroundings
might have no contractions of the
stomach for two or three hours. And whenever
the animals showed any indications of being uncomfortable
or distressed, the contractions were
inhibited and the discharge of contents from the
stomach checked.</p>

<p>Like the peristaltic waves in the stomach, the
peristalsis and the kneading movements (segmentation)
in the small intestine, and the reversed
peristalsis in the large intestine all cease
whenever the observed animal shows signs of
emotional excitement.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that just as the secretory
activity of the stomach is affected in a similar
fashion in man and in lower animals, so likewise
gastric and intestinal peristaltic waves are
stopped in man as they are stopped in lower animals,
by worry and anxiety and the stronger
affective states. The conditions of mental discord
may thus give rise to a sense of gastric inertia.
For example, a patient described by <span class="nowrap">Müller<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
testified that anxiety was always accompanied by
a feeling of weight, as if the food remained in
the stomach. Every addition of food caused an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span>
increase of the trouble. Strong emotional states
in this instance led almost always to gastric distress,
which persisted, according to the grade and
the duration of the psychic disturbance, between
a half-hour and several days. The patient was
not hysterical or neurasthenic, but was a very
sensitive woman deeply affected by moods.</p>

<p>The feeling of heaviness in the stomach, mentioned
in the foregoing case, is not uncommonly
complained of by nervous persons, and may be
due to stagnation of the contents. That such
stagnation occurs is shown by the following instance.
A refined and sensitive woman, who had
had digestive difficulties, came with her husband
to Boston to be examined. They went to a hotel
for the night. The next morning the woman appeared
at the consultant’s office an hour after
having eaten a test meal. An examination of the
gastric contents revealed no free acid, no digestion
of the test breakfast, and the presence of a
considerable amount of the supper of the previous
evening. The explanation of this stagnation
of the food in the stomach came from the
family doctor, who reported that the husband
had made the visit to the city an occasion for becoming
uncontrollably drunk, and that he had
by his escapades given his wife a night of turbulent
anxiety. The second morning, after the
woman had had a good rest, the gastric contents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>
were again examined; the proper acidity
was found, and the test breakfast had been normally
digested and discharged.</p>

<p>These cases are merely illustrative and doubtless
can be many times duplicated in the experience
of any physician concerned largely with digestive
disorders. Indeed, the opinion has been
expressed that a great majority of the cases of
gastric indigestion that come for treatment are
functional in character and of nervous origin.
It is the emotional element that seems most characteristic
of these cases. To so great an extent
is this true that Rosenbach has suggested that as
a term to characterize the cause of the disturbances,
“emotional” dyspepsia is better than
“nervous” <span class="nowrap">dyspepsia.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Disturbing Effect of Pain on Digestion</span></h3>

<p>The advocates of the theory of organic evolution
early pointed out the similarity between the
bodily disturbances in pain and in the major emotions.
The alterations of function of internal organs
they could not know about. The general
statement, however, that pain evokes the same
changes that are evoked by emotion, is true also
of these deep-lying structures. <span class="nowrap">Wertheimer<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
proved many years since that stimulation of a
sensory nerve in an anesthetized animal&mdash;such
stimulation as in a conscious animal would induce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>
pain&mdash;quickly abolished the contractions of
the stomach. And Netschaiev, working in <span class="nowrap">Pawlow’s<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span>
laboratory, showed that excitation of
the sensory fibres in the sciatic nerve for two or
three minutes resulted in an inhibition of the
secretion of gastric juice that lasted for several
hours. Similar effects from painful experience
have been not uncommonly noted in human beings.
<span class="nowrap">Mantegazza,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> in his account of the physiology
of pain, has cited a number of such examples,
and from them he has concluded that pain
interferes with digestion by lessening appetite
and by producing various forms of dyspepsia,
with arrest of gastric digestion, and with vomiting
and diarrhea. The expression, “sickening
pain” is testimony to the power of strong sensory
stimulation to upset the digestive processes profoundly.
Vomiting is as likely to follow violent
pain as it is to follow strong emotion. A “sick
headache” may be, indeed, a sequence of events
in which the pain from the headache is primary,
and the nausea and other evidences of digestive
disorder are secondary.</p>

<p>As the foregoing account has shown, emotional
conditions or “feelings” may be accompanied by
quite opposite effects in the alimentary canal,
some highly favorable to good digestion, some
highly disturbing. It is an interesting fact that
the feelings having these antagonistic actions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span>
typically expressed through nerve supplies which
are correspondingly opposed in their influence
on the digestive organs. The antagonism between
these nerve supplies is of fundamental importance
in understanding not only the operation of
conditions favorable or unfavorable to digestion
but also in obtaining insight into the conflicts of
emotional states. Since a consideration of the
arrangement and mode of action of these nerves
will establish a firm basis for later analysis and
conclusions, they will next be considered.</p>

<p class="center">THE GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE
VISCERAL NERVES CONCERNED IN EMOTIONS</p>


<p class="sp2">The structures of the alimentary canal which
are brought into activity during the satisfactions
of appetite or are checked in their activity during
pain and emotional excitement are either the secreting
digestive glands or the smooth muscle
which surrounds the canal. Both the gland cells
and the smooth-muscle cells differ from other
cells which are subject to nervous influence&mdash;those
of striated, or skeletal, muscle&mdash;in not being
directly under voluntary control and in being
slower in their response. The muscle connected
with the skeleton responds to stimulation within
two or three thousandths of a second; the delay
with gland cells and with smooth muscle is more
likely to be measured in seconds than in fractions
of a second.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Outlying Neurones</span></h3>

<p>The skeletal muscles receive their nerve supply
direct from the central nervous system, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>
nerve fibres distributed to these muscles are parts
of neurones whose cell bodies lie within the brain
or spinal cord. The glands and smooth muscles
of the viscera, on the contrary, are, so far as is
now known, never innervated directly from the
central nervous <span class="nowrap">system.<a id="SNanchor_2" href="#Starnote_2" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> The neurones reaching
out from the brain or spinal cord never come into
immediate relation with the gland or smooth-muscle
cells; there are always interposed between
the cerebrospinal neurones and the viscera extra
neurones whose bodies and processes lie wholly
outside the central nervous system. They are
represented in dotted lines in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>. I have suggested
that possibly these outlying neurones act
as “transformers,” modifying the impulses received
from the central source (impulses suited to
call forth the quick responses of <em>skeletal</em> muscle),
and adapting these impulses to the peculiar, more
slowly-acting tissues, the secreting cells and visceral
muscle, to which they are <span class="nowrap">distributed.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>



<div class="starnote">

<p><a id="Starnote_2" href="#SNanchor_2" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>The special case of the adrenal glands will be considered later.</p>

</div>


<p>The outlying neurones typically have their cell
bodies grouped in ganglia (G’s, <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>) which, in
the trunk region, lie along either side of the spinal
cord and in the head region and in the pelvic
part of the abdominal cavity are disposed near
the organs which the neurones supply. In some
instances these neurones lie wholly within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>
structure which they innervate (see <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, the heart
and the stomach, <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>). In other instances the
fibres passing out from the ganglia&mdash;the so-called
“postganglionic fibres”&mdash;may traverse long distances
before reaching their destination. The innervation
of blood vessels in the foot by neurones
whose cell bodies are in the lower trunk region
is an example of this extensive distribution of the
fibres.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Three Divisions of the Outlying Neurones</span></h3>

<p>As suggested above, the outlying neurones are
connected with the brain and spinal cord by
neurones whose cell bodies lie within the central
nervous organs. These connecting neurones, represented
in continuous lines in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>, do not pass
out in a continuous series all along the cerebrospinal
axis. Where the nerves pass out from the
spinal cord to the fore and hind limbs, fibres are
not given off to the ganglia. Thus these connecting
or “preganglionic” fibres are separated into
three divisions. In front of the nerve roots for
the fore limbs is the head or cranial division, between
the nerve roots for the fore limbs and those
for the hind limbs is the trunk division (or thoracico-lumbar
division, or, in the older terminology,
the “sympathetic system”); and after the nerve
roots for the hind limbs the sacral division.</p>

<p>This system of outlying neurones, with postganglionic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>
fibres innervating the viscera, and with
preganglionic fibres reaching out to them from
the cerebrospinal system, has been called by
Langley, to whom we are indebted for most of
our knowledge of its organization, the <em>autonomic
nervous</em> <span class="nowrap"><em>system</em>.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> This term indicates that the
structures which the system supplies are not subject
to voluntary control, but operate to a large
degree independently. As we have seen, a highly
potent mode of influencing these structures is
through conditions of pain and emotional excitement.
The parts of the autonomic system&mdash;the
cranial, the sympathetic, and the sacral&mdash;have a
number of peculiarities which are of prime importance
in accounting for the bodily manifestations
of such affective states.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Extensive Distribution of Neurones of the “Sympathetic”
Division and Their Arrangement for Diffuse
Action</span></h3>

<p>The fibres of the sympathetic division differ
from those of the other two divisions in being
distributed through the body very widely. They
go to the eyes, causing dilation of the pupils.
They go to the heart and, when stimulated, they
cause it to beat rapidly. They carry impulses to
arteries and arterioles of the skin, the abdominal
viscera, and other parts, keeping the smooth muscles
of the vessel walls in a state of slight contraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>
or tone, and thus serving to maintain
an arterial pressure sufficiently high to meet sudden
demands in any special region; or, in times
of special discharge of impulses, to increase the
tone and thus also the arterial pressure. They
are distributed extensively to the smooth muscle
attached to the hairs; and when they cause this
muscle to contract, the hairs are erected. They
go to sweat glands, causing the outpouring of
sweat. These fibres pass also to the entire length
of the gastro-intestinal canal. And the inhibition
of digestive activity which, as we have
learned, occurs in pain and emotional states, is
due to impulses which are conducted outward by
the <em>splanchnic nerves</em>&mdash;the preganglionic fibres
that reach to the great ganglia in the upper abdomen
(see <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>)&mdash;and thence are spread by postganglionic
fibres all along the <span class="nowrap">gut.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> They innervate
likewise the genito-urinary tracts, causing
contraction of the smooth muscle of the internal
genital organs, and usually relaxation of the bladder.
Finally they affect the liver, releasing the
storage of material there in a manner which may
be of great service to the body in time of need.
The <em>extensiveness</em> of the distribution of the fibres
of the sympathetic division is one of its most
prominent characteristics.</p>

<p>Another typical feature of the sympathetic division
is an arrangement of neurones for diffuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
discharge of the nerve impulses. As shown diagrammatically
in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>, the preganglionic fibres
from the central nervous system may extend
through several of the sympathetic ganglia and
give off in each of them connections to cell bodies
of the outlying neurones. Although the neurones
which transmit sensory impulses from the skin
into spinal cord have similar relations to nerve
cells lying at different levels of the cord, the operation
in the two cases is quite different. In
the spinal cord the sensory impulse produces directed
and closely limited effects, as, for example,
when reflexes are being evoked in a “spinal” animal
(<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, an animal with the spinal cord isolated
from the rest of the central nervous system), the
left hind limb is nicely lifted, in response to a
harmful stimulus applied to the left foot, without
widespread marked involvement of the rest of
the body in the <span class="nowrap">response.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> In the action of the
sympathetic division, on the contrary, the connection
of single preganglionic fibres with numerous
outlying neurones seems to be not at all
arranged for specific effects in this or that particular
region. There are, to be sure, in different
circumstances variations in the degree of activity
of different parts; for example, it is probable
that dilation of the pupil in the cat occurs
more readily than erection of the hairs. It may
be in this instance, however, that specially direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>
pathways to the eye are present for common use
in non-emotional states (in dim light, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>), and
that only slight general disturbance in the central
nervous system, therefore, would be necessary to
send impulses by these well-worn courses. Thus
for local reasons (dust, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>) tears might flow
from excitation of the tear glands by sympathetic
impulses, although other parts innervated by this
same division might be but little disturbed. We
have no means of voluntarily wearing these pathways,
however, and both from anatomical and
physiological evidence the neurone relations in
the sympathetic division of the autonomic system
seem devised for widespread diffusion of nervous
impulses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Arrangement of Neurones of the Cranial and Sacral
Divisions for Specific Action</span></h3>

<p>The cranial and sacral autonomic divisions
differ from the sympathetic in having only <em>restricted</em>
distribution (see <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>). The third cranial
nerves deliver impulses from the brain to
ganglia in which lie the cell bodies of neurones
innervating smooth muscle only in the front of
the eyes. The vagus nerves are distributed to
the lungs, heart, stomach, and small intestine.
As shown diagrammatically in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>, the outlying
neurones in the last three of these organs
lie within the organs themselves. By this arrangement,
although the preganglionic fibres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>
the vagi are extended in various directions to
structures of quite diverse functions, singleness
and separateness of connection of the peripheral
organs with the central nervous system is assured.
The same specific relation between efferent
fibres and the viscera is seen in the sacral
autonomic. In this division the preganglionic
fibres pass out from the spinal cord to ganglia
lying in close proximity to the distal colon, the
bladder, and the external genitals. And the postganglionic
fibres deliver the nerve impulses only
to the nearby organs. Besides these innervations
the cranial and sacral divisions supply individual
arteries with “dilator nerves”&mdash;nerves causing
relaxation of the particular vessels. Quite typically,
therefore, the efferent fibres of the two
terminal divisions of the autonomic differ from
those of the mid-division in having few of the
distributed connections characteristic of the mid-division,
and in innervating distinctively the organs
to which they are distributed. The cranial
and sacral preganglionic fibres resemble thus the
nerves to skeletal muscles, and their arrangement
provides similar possibilities of specific and separate
action in any part, without action in other
parts.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cranial Division a Conserver of Bodily Resources</span></h3>

<p>The cranial autonomic, represented by the
vagus nerves, is the part of the visceral nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>
system concerned in the psychic secretion of the
gastric juice. Pawlow showed that when these
nerves are severed psychic secretion is abolished.
The cranial nerves to the salivary glands are similarly
the agents for psychic secretion in these
organs, and are known to cause also dilation of the
arteries supplying the glands, so that during activity
the glands receive a more abundant flow of
blood. As previously stated (see <a href=#Page_13>p. 13</a>), the evidence
for a psychic tonus of the gastro-intestinal
musculature rests on a failure of the normal contractions
if the vagi are severed before food is
taken, in contrast to the continuance of the contractions
if the nerves are severed just afterwards.
The vagi artificially excited are well known
as stimulators of increased tone in the
smooth muscle of the alimentary canal. Aside
from these positive effects on the muscles of the
digestive tract and its accessory glands, cranial
autonomic fibres cause contraction of the pupil
of the eye, and slowing of the heart rate.</p>

<p>A glance at these various functions of the cranial
division reveals at once that they serve for
bodily conservation. By narrowing the pupil of
the eye they shield the retina from excessive
light. By slowing the heart rate, they give the
cardiac muscle longer periods for rest and invigoration.
And by providing for the flow of
saliva and gastric juice and by supplying the muscular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
tone necessary for contraction of the alimentary
canal, they prove fundamentally essential
to the processes of proper digestion and
absorption by which energy-yielding material is
taken into the body and stored. To the cranial
division of the visceral nerves, therefore, belongs
the quiet service of building up reserves and fortifying
the body against times of need or stress.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sacral Division a Group of Mechanisms for Emptying</span></h3>

<p>Sacral autonomic fibres cause contraction of the
rectum and distal colon and also contraction of
the bladder. In both instances the effects result
reflexly from stretching of the tonically contracted
viscera by their accumulating contents.
No affective states precede this normal action of
the sacral division and even those which accompany
or follow are only mildly positive; a feeling
of relief rather than of elation usually attends
the completion of the act of defecation or micturition&mdash;though
there is testimony to the contrary.</p>

<p>The sacral autonomic fibres also include, however,
the nervi erigentes which bring about engorgement
of erectile tissue in the external genitals.
According to Langley and <span class="nowrap">Anderson<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> the
sacral nerves have no effect on the <em>internal</em> generative
organs. The vasa deferentia and the
seminal vesicles whose rhythmic contractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>
mark the acme of sexual excitement in the male,
and the uterus whose contractions in the female
are probably analogous, are supplied only by
lumbar branches&mdash;part of the sympathetic division.
These branches also act in opposition to
the nervi erigentes and cause constriction of the
blood vessels of the external genitals. The sexual
orgasm involves a high degree of emotional excitement;
but it can be rightly considered as essentially
a reflex mechanism; and, again in this
instance, distention of tubules, vesicles, and blood
vessels can be found at the beginning of the incident,
and relief from this distention at the end.</p>

<p>Although distention is the commonest occasion
for bringing the sacral division into activity it is
not the only occasion. Great emotion, such as is
accompanied by nervous discharges via the sympathetic
division, may also be accompanied by discharges
via the sacral fibres. The involuntary
voiding of the bladder and lower gut at times of
violent mental stress is well known. Veterans of
wars testify that just before the beginning of a
battle many of the men have to retire temporarily
from the firing line. And the power of sights
and smells and libidinous thoughts to disturb the
regions controlled by the nervi erigentes proves
that this part of the autonomic system also has
its peculiar affective states. The fact that one
part of the sacral division, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, the distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span>
to the bladder, may be in abeyance, while
another part, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, the distribution to the rectum,
is active, illustrates again the directive discharge
of impulses which has been previously described
as characteristic of the cranial and sacral portions
of the autonomic system.</p>

<p>Like the cranial division, the sacral is engaged
in internal service to the body, in the performance
of acts leading immediately to greater comfort.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sympathetic Division Antagonistic To Both The
Cranial and the Sacral</span></h3>

<p>As indicated in the foregoing description many
of the viscera are innervated both by the cranial
or sacral part of the autonomic and by the sympathetic.
<em>When the mid-part meets either end-part
in any viscus their effects are antagonistic.</em>
Thus the cranial supply to the eye contracts the
pupil, the sympathetic dilates it; the cranial
slows the heart, the sympathetic accelerates it;
the sacral contracts the lower part of the large
intestine, the sympathetic relaxes it; the sacral
relaxes the exit from the bladder, the sympathetic
contracts it. These opposed effects
are indicated in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a> by + for contraction, acceleration
or increased tone; and by - for inhibition,
relaxation, or decreased <span class="nowrap">tone.<a id="SNanchor_3" href="#Starnote_3" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_3" href="#SNanchor_3" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The vagus nerve, when artificially stimulated, has a primary,
brief inhibitory effect on the stomach and small intestine;
its main function, however, as already stated, is to produce
increased tone and contraction in these organs. This
double action of the vagus is marked thus, ∓, in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span></p>

<p>Sherrington has demonstrated that the setting
of skeletal muscles in opposed groups about a
joint or system of joints&mdash;as in flexors and extensors&mdash;is
associated with an internal organization
of the central nervous system that provides
for relaxation of one group of the opposed muscles
when the other group is made to contract.
This “reciprocal innervation of antagonistic muscles,”
as Sherrington has called <span class="nowrap">it,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> is thus a
device for orderly action in the body. As the
above description has shown, there are peripheral
oppositions in the viscera corresponding to the
oppositions between flexor and extensor muscles.
In all probability these opposed innervations of
the viscera have counterparts in the organization
of neurones in the central nervous system. Sherrington
has noticed, and I can confirm the observation,
that even though the sympathetic supply
to the eye is severed and is therefore incapable of
causing dilation of the pupil, nevertheless the
pupil dilates in a paroxysm of anger&mdash;due, no
doubt (because the response is too rapid to be
mediated by the blood stream), to central inhibition
of the cranial nerve supply to the constrictor
muscles&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, an inhibition of the muscles which
naturally oppose the dilator action of the sympathetic.
Pain, the major emotions&mdash;fear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
rage&mdash;and also intense excitement, are manifested
in the activities of the sympathetic division.
When in these states impulses rush out over the
neurones of this division they produce all the
changes typical of sympathetic excitation, such
as dilating the pupils, inhibiting digestion, causing
pallor, accelerating the heart, and various
other well-known effects. The impulses of the
sympathetic neurones, as indicated by their dominance
over the digestive process, are capable of
readily overwhelming the conditions established
by neurones of the cranial division of the autonomic
system.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neurones of the Sympathetic Division and Adrenal
Secretion Have the Same Action</span></h3>

<p>Lying anterior to each kidney is a small body&mdash;the
adrenal gland. It is composed of an external
portion or cortex, and a central portion or medulla.
From the medulla can be extracted a substance,
called variously suprarenin, adrenin, epinephrin
or <span class="nowrap">“adrenalin,”<a id="SNanchor_4" href="#Starnote_4" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> which, in extraordinarily
minute amounts, affects the structures innervated
by the sympathetic division of the autonomic system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span>
precisely as if they were receiving nervous
impulses. For example, when adrenin is injected
into the blood, it will cause pupils to dilate, hairs
to stand erect, blood vessels to be constricted, the
activities of the alimentary canal to be inhibited,
and sugar to be liberated from the liver. These
effects are not produced by action of the substance
on the central nervous system, but by direct action
on the organ <span class="nowrap">itself.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> And the effects occur
even after the structures have been removed
from the body and kept alive artificially.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_4" href="#SNanchor_4" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The name “adrenalin” is proprietary. “Epinephrin” and
“adrenin” have been suggested as terms free from commercial
suggestions. As <em>adrenin</em> is shorter and more clearly
related to the common adjectival form, <em>adrenal</em>, I have followed
Schäfer in using <em>adrenin</em> to designate the substance
produced physiologically by the adrenal glands.</p>
</div>

<p>The adrenals are glands of internal secretion,
<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, like the thyroid, parathyroid, and pituitary
glands, for example; they have no connection with
the surface of the body, and they give out into
the blood the material which they elaborate. The
blood is carried away from each of them by the
lumbo-adrenal vein which empties either into the
renal vein or directly into the inferior vena cava
just anterior to the openings of the renal veins.
The adrenal glands are supplied by preganglionic
fibres of the autonomic <span class="nowrap">group,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> shown in solid
line in <a href=#Figure_1>Fig. 1</a>. This seems an exception to the
general rule that gland cells have an outlying
neurone between them and the neurones of the
central nervous system. The medulla of the adrenal
gland, however, is composed of modified nerve
cells, and may therefore be regarded as offering
exceptional conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span></p>

<p>The foregoing brief sketch of the organization
of the autonomic system brings out a number of
points that should be of importance as bearing
on the nature of the emotions which manifest
themselves in the operations of this system. Thus
it is highly probable that the sympathetic division,
because arranged for diffuse discharge, is likely
to be brought into activity as a whole, whereas
the sacral and cranial divisions, arranged for
particular action on separate organs, may operate
in parts. Also, because antagonisms exist between
the middle and either end division of the
autonomic, affective states may be classified according
to their expression in the middle or an
end division and these states would be, like the
nerves, antagonistic in character. And finally,
since the adrenal glands are innervated by autonomic
fibres of the mid-division, and since adrenal
secretion stimulates the same activities that
are stimulated nervously by this division, it is
possible that disturbances in the realm of the
sympathetic, although initiated by nervous discharge,
are automatically augmented and prolonged
through chemical effects of the adrenal
secretion.</p>

<p class="center">METHODS OF DEMONSTRATING ADRENAL
SECRETION AND ITS NERVOUS CONTROL</p>


<p class="sp2">As stated in the first chapter, the inhibition of
gastric secretion produced by great excitement
long outlasts the presence of the object which
evokes the excitement. The dog that was enraged
by seeing a cat for five minutes secreted
only a few drops of gastric juice during the next
fifteen minutes. Why did the state of excitation
persist so long after the period of stimulation had
ended? This question, which presented itself to
me while reading Bickel and Sasaki’s paper, furnished
the suggestion expressed at the close of
the last chapter, that the excitement might provoke
a flow of adrenal secretion, and that the
changes originally induced in the digestive organs
by nervous impulses might be continued by circulating
adrenin. The prolongation of the effect
might be thus explained. Whether that idea is
correct or not has not been tested. Its chief service
was in leading to an enquiry as to whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span>
the adrenal glands are in fact stimulated to action
in emotional excitement. The preganglionic fibres
passing to the glands are contained in the splanchnic
nerves. What is the effect of splanchnic stimulation?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Evidence that Splanchnic Stimulation Induces
Adrenal Secretion</span></h3>

<p>It was in 1891 that <span class="nowrap">Jacobi<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> described nerve
fibres derived from the splanchnic trunks which
were distributed to the adrenal glands. Six years
later <span class="nowrap">Biedl<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> found that these nerves conveyed
vasodilator impulses to the glands, and he suggested
that they probably conveyed also secretory
impulses. Evidence in support of this suggestion
was presented the following year by
<span class="nowrap">Dreyer,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> who demonstrated that electrical excitation
of the splanchnic nerves produced in the
blood taken from the adrenal veins an increased
amount of a substance having the power of raising
arterial blood pressure, and that this result
was independent of accompanying changes in the
blood supply to the glands. The conclusion drawn
by Dreyer that this substance was adrenin has
been confirmed in various ways by later observers.
<span class="nowrap">Tscheboksaroff<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> repeated Dreyer’s procedure
and found in blood taken from the veins after
splanchnic stimulation evidences of the presence
of adrenin that were previously absent. <span class="nowrap">Asher<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span>
observed a rise of blood pressure when the glands
were stimulated in such a manner as not to cause
constriction of the arteries&mdash;the rise was therefore
assumed to be due to secreted adrenin.
Dilation of the pupil was used by Meltzer and
<span class="nowrap">Joseph<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> to prove secretory action of the splanchnics
on the adrenal glands; they found that stimulation
of the distal portion of the cut splanchnic
nerve caused the pupil to enlarge&mdash;an effect characteristic
of adrenin circulating in the blood.
<span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> repeated this procedure, but made it
a more rigorous proof of internal secretion of the
adrenals by noting that the effect failed to appear
if the gland on the stimulated side was removed.
Additional proof was brought by myself
and <span class="nowrap">Lyman<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> when we found that the typical
drop in arterial pressure produced in cats by injecting
small amounts of adrenin could be exactly
reproduced by stimulating the splanchnic
nerves after the abdominal blood vessels, which
contract when these nerves are excited, were tied
so that no changes in them could occur to influence
the rest of the circulation.</p>

<p>The problem of splanchnic influence on the adrenal
glands Elliott attacked by a still different
method. Using, as a measure, the graded effects
of graded amounts of adrenin on blood pressure,
he was able to assay the quantity of adrenin in
adrenal glands after various conditions had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>
allowed to prevail. The tests were made on cats.
In these animals each adrenal gland is supplied
only by the splanchnic fibres of its own side, and
the two glands normally contain almost exactly the
same amount of adrenin. <span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> found that
when the gland on one side was isolated by cutting
its splanchnic supply, and then impulses were sent
along the intact nerves of the other side, either
by disturbing the animal or by artificial excitation
of the nerves, the gland to which these fibres
reached invariably contained less adrenin, often
very much less, than the isolated gland. Results
obtained by the method employed by Elliott have
been confirmed with remarkable exactness in results
obtained by Folin, Denis and <span class="nowrap">myself,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
using a highly sensitive color test after adding
the gland extract to a solution of phosphotungstic
acid.</p>

<p>All these observations, with a variety of methods,
and by a respectable number of reliable investigators,
are harmonious in bringing proof
that artificial stimulation of the nerves leading
to the adrenal glands will induce secretory activity
in the adrenal medulla, and that in consequence
adrenin will be increased in the blood.
The fact is therefore securely established that in
the body a mechanism exists by which these
glands can be made to discharge this peculiar substance
promptly into the circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Question of Adrenal Secretion in Emotional
Excitement</span></h3>

<p>As we have already seen, the phenomena of a
great emotional disturbance in an animal indicate
that sympathetic impulses dominate the viscera.
When, for example, a cat becomes frightened,
the pupils dilate, the activities of the
stomach and intestines are inhibited, the heart
beats rapidly, the hairs of the back and tail stand
erect&mdash;from one end of the animal to the other
there are abundant signs of nervous discharges
along sympathetic courses. Do not the adrenal
glands share in this widespread subjugation of
the viscera to sympathetic control?</p>

<p>This question, whether the common excitements
of an animal’s life might be capable of evoking
a discharge of adrenin, was taken up by D. de la
Paz and myself in 1910. We made use of the natural
enmity between two laboratory animals, the
dog and the cat, to pursue our experiments. In
these experiments the cat, fastened in a comfortable
holder (the holder already mentioned as being
used in X-ray studies of the movements of
the alimentary canal), was placed near a barking
dog. Some cats when thus treated showed almost
no signs of fear; others, with scarcely a
movement of defense, presented the typical picture.
In favorable cases the excitement was allowed
to prevail for five or ten minutes, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>
a few cases longer. Samples of blood were taken
within a few minutes before and after the period.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Method of Securing Blood from Near the Adrenal
Veins</span></h3>

<p>The blood was obtained from the inferior vena
cava anterior to the opening of the adrenal veins,
<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, at a point inside the body near the level of
the notch at the lower end of the sternum. To
get the blood so far from the surface without
disturbing the animal was at first a difficult problem.
We found, however, that by making anesthetic
with ethyl chloride the skin directly over
the femoral vein high in the groin, the vein could
be quickly bared, cleared of connective tissue,
tied, and opened without causing any general disturbance
whatever. A long, fine, flexible catheter
(2.4 millimeters in diameter) which had previously
been coated with vaseline inside and out,
to lubricate it and to delay the clotting of blood
within it, was now introduced into the opening in
the femoral vein, thence through the iliac and
on into the inferior cava to a point near the level
of the sternal notch. A thread tied around this
tube where, after being inserted to the proper distance,
it disappeared into the femoral vein,
marked the extent of insertion, and permitted a
later introduction to the same extent. This slight
operation&mdash;a venesection, commonly practised on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span>
our ancestors&mdash;consumed only a few minutes, and
as the only possibility of causing pain was
guarded against by local anesthesia, the animal
remained tranquil throughout. Occasionally it
was necessary to stroke the cat’s head gently to
keep her quiet on the holder, and under such circumstances
I have known her to purr during all
the preparations for obtaining the blood, and
while the blood was being taken.</p>

<p>The blood (3 or 4 cubic centimeters) was slowly
drawn through the catheter into a clean glass
syringe. Care was taken to avoid any marked
suction such as might cause collapse of the vein
near the inner opening of the tube. As soon as
the blood was secured, the catheter was removed
and the vein tied loosely, to prevent bleeding.
The blood was at once emptied into a beaker, and
the fibrin whipped from it by means of fringed
rubber tubing fitted over a glass rod. Since this
defibrinated blood was obtained while the animal
was undisturbed, it was labelled “quiet
blood.”</p>

<p>The animal was then exposed to the barking
dog, as already described, and immediately thereafter
blood was again removed, from precisely
the same region as before. This sample, after
being defibrinated, was labelled “excited blood.”
The two samples, the “quiet” and the “excited,”
both obtained in the same manner and subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>
treated in the same manner, were now
tested for their content of adrenin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Method of Testing the Blood for Adrenin</span></h3>

<p>It was desirable to use as a test tissues to
which the blood was naturally related. As will
be recalled, adrenin affects viscera even after
they have been removed from the body, just as if
they were receiving impulses via sympathetic
fibres, and further, that sympathetic fibres normally
deliver impulses which cause contraction
of the internal genitals and relaxation of the
stomach and intestines. The uterus has long been
employed as a test for adrenin, the presence of
which it indicates by increased contraction. That
isolated strips of the longitudinal muscle of the
intestine, which are contracting rhythmically, are
characteristically inhibited by adrenin in dilutions
of 1 part in 20 millions, had been shown by
Magnus in 1905. Although, previous to our investigation
in 1910, this extremely delicate reaction
had not been used as a biological signal for
adrenin, it possesses noteworthy advantages over
other methods. The intestine is found in all animals
and not in only half of them, as is the uterus;
it is ready for the test within a few minutes, instead
of the several hours said to be required for
the best use of the uterus <span class="nowrap">preparation;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> and it
responds by relaxing. This last characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>
is especially important, for in defibrinated blood
there are, besides adrenin, other substances capable
of causing contraction of smooth <span class="nowrap">muscle,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
and liable therefore to lead to erroneous conclusions
when a structure which responds by contracting,
such as uterus or artery, is used to prove
whether adrenin is present. On the other hand,
substances producing relaxation of smooth muscle
are few, and are unusual in <span class="nowrap">blood.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>We used, therefore, the strip of intestinal muscle
as an indicator. Later <span class="nowrap">Hoskins<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> modified
our procedure by taking, instead of the strip, a
short segment of the rabbit intestine. The segment
is not subjected to danger of injury during
its preparation, and when fresh it is almost incredibly
sensitive. It may be noticeably inhibited
by adrenin, 1 part in 200 millions!</p>

<p>The strip, or the intestinal segment, was suspended
between minute wire pincers (<i lang="fr">serres
fines</i>) in a cylindrical chamber 8 millimeters in
diameter and 5 centimeters deep. By a thread
attached to the lower serre fine the preparation
was drawn into the chamber, and was held firmly;
by the upper one it was attached to the short end
of a writing lever (see <a href=#Figure_2>Fig. 2</a>). When not exposed
to blood, the strip was immersed in a normal
solution of the blood salts (Ringer’s). The
blood or the salt solution could be quickly withdrawn
from or introduced into the chamber, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
disturbing the muscle, by means of a fine
pipette passed down along the inner surface. The
chamber and its contents, the stock of Ringer’s
solution, and the samples of “quiet” and “excited”
blood were all surrounded by a large volume
of water kept approximately at body temperature
(37°&nbsp;C.). Through the blood or the salt
solution in the chamber oxygen was passed in a
slow but steady stream of bubbles. Under these
circumstances the strip will live for hours, and
will contract and relax in a beautifully regular
rhythm, which may be recorded graphically by
the writing lever.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_2">
  <img class="w90" src="images/fig2.png" alt="">
  <figcaption><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the arrangements for recording contractions
of the intestinal muscle.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first effect of surrounding the muscle with
blood, whether “quiet” or “excited,” was to send
it into a strong contraction which might persist,
sometimes with slight oscillations, for a minute
or two (see <a href=#Figure_4>Figs. 4</a> and <a href=#Figure_5>5</a>). After the initial shortening,
the strip, if in quiet blood soon began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>
contract and relax rhythmically and with each relaxation
to lengthen more, until a fairly even
base line appeared in the written record. At this
stage the addition of fresh “quiet” blood usually
had no effect, even though the strip were washed
once with Ringer’s solution before the second portion
of the blood was added. For comparison of
the effects of “quiet” and “excited” blood on the
contracting strip, the two samples were each
added to the muscle immediately after the Ringer’s
solution had been removed, or they were applied
to the muscle alternately and the differences
in effect then noted. The results obtained by
these methods are next to be presented.</p>

<p class="center">ADRENAL SECRETION IN STRONG EMOTIONS
AND PAIN</p>


<p class="sp2">If the secretion of adrenin is increased in strong
emotional states and in pain, that constitutes a
fact of considerable significance, for, as already
mentioned, adrenin is capable of producing many
of the bodily changes which are characteristically
manifested in emotional and painful experiences.
It is a matter of prime importance for further
discussion to determine whether the adrenal
glands are in fact roused to special activity in
times of stress.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Evidence that Adrenal Secretion Is Increased in
Emotional Excitement</span></h3>

<p>That blood from the adrenal veins causes the
relaxation of intestinal muscle characteristic of
adrenal extract or adrenin is shown in <a href=#Figure_3>Fig. 3</a>.
The muscle was originally beating in blood which
contained no demonstrable amount of adrenal secretion;
this inactive blood was replaced by blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span>
from the adrenal veins, obtained after quick
etherization. Etherization, it will be recalled, is
accompanied by a “stage of excitement.” Relaxation
occurred almost immediately (at <i>b</i>).
Then the rhythm was renewed in the former
blood, and thereupon the muscle was surrounded
with blood from the vein leading away from the
left kidney, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, blood obtained from the same
animal and under the same conditions as the
adrenal blood, but from a neighboring vein. No
relaxation occurred. By this and other similar
tests the reliability of the method was proved.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_3">

  <figcaption><p><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;Intestinal muscle beating

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span></p>

<p>In no instance did blood from the inferior vena
cava of the quiet normal animal produce relaxation.
On the other hand, blood from the animal
after emotional excitement showed more or less
promptly the typical relaxation. In <a href=#Figure_4>Fig. 4</a> is
represented the record of intestinal muscle which
was beating regularly in Ringer’s solution. At <i>a</i>
the Ringer’s solution was removed, and at <i>b</i> “excited”
blood was added; after the preliminary
shortening, which, as already stated, occurs at
the first immersion in blood, the muscle lengthened
gradually into complete inhibition. At <i>c</i> the
“excited” blood was removed, and at <i>d</i> “quiet”
blood was added in its place. The muscle at once
began fairly regular rhythmic beats. At <i>e</i> the
“quiet” blood was removed, and at <i>f</i> the “excited”
blood was again applied. The muscle lengthened
almost immediately into an inhibited state. In
this instance the “excited” blood was taken after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>
the cat had been barked at for about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The increase of effect with prolongation of the
period of excitement is shown in <a href=#Figure_5>Fig. 5</a>. <i>A</i> is the
record of contractions after the muscle was surrounded

gradual inhibition which occurred when the muscle

And <i>C</i> is the record of rapid inhibition after fifteen
minutes of excitement. In other instances
the effect was manifested merely by a lowering
of the tonus of the muscle, and a notable slowing
of the beats, without, however, a total abolition
of them.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The inference that this inhibition of contraction
of the intestinal muscle is due to an increased
amount of adrenal secretion in the “excited”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>
blood de la Paz and I justified on several grounds:</p>

<p>(1) The inhibition was produced by “excited”
blood from the inferior vena cava anterior to the
mouths of the adrenal veins, when blood from the
femoral vein, taken at the same time, had no inhibitory
influence. Since blood from the femoral
vein is typical of the cava blood below the entrance
of the kidney veins, the conclusion is warranted
that the difference of effect of the two
samples of blood is not due to any agent below
the kidneys. But that blood from the kidneys
does not cause the relaxation is shown in <a href=#Figure_3>Fig. 3</a>.
The only other structures which could alter the
blood between the two points at which it was
taken are the adrenal glands, and the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span>
secreted by them would produce precisely the
inhibition of contraction which was in fact produced.</p>

<p>(2) If in ether anesthesia the blood vessels
leading to and from the adrenal glands are first
carefully tied, and then the glands are removed, excitement
four or five hours later, before the weakness
that follows the removal has become prominent,
does not alter the blood so that the typical
inhibition occurs (see <a href=#Figure_6>Fig. 6</a>). Thus, although
the animal shows all the characteristic signs of
sympathetic stimulation, the blood, in the absence
of the adrenals, remains unchanged.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_6">
  <img class="w90" src="images/fig6.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 6.</span>&mdash;Failure of the cava blood

excitement has occurred after removal

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>(3) As already shown, sometimes the effect produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>
by the “excited” blood was prompt inhibition,
sometimes the inhibition followed only after
several beats, and sometimes a slowing and shortening
of contractions, with a lower tone, were the
sole signs of the action of adrenin. All these
degrees of relaxation can be duplicated by adding
to inactive blood varying amounts of adrenin.
<a href=#Figure_7>Fig. 7</a> shows the effects, on a somewhat insensitive
muscle preparation, of adding adrenin,
1:1,000,000 (A), 1:2,000,000 (B), and 1:3,000,000
(C), to different samples of blood previously without
inhibitory influence. These effects of adrenin
and the effects produced by blood taken near the
opening of the adrenal veins are strikingly analogous.</p>

<p>(4) Embden and v. <span class="nowrap">Furth<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> have reported that
0.1 gram of suprarenin chloride disappears almost
completely in two hours if added to 200 cubic
centimeters of defibrinated beef blood, and the
mixture constantly aerated at body temperature.
“Excited” blood which produces inhibition loses
that power on standing in the cold for twenty-four
hours, or on being kept warm and agitated with
bubbling oxygen. This change is illustrated in
<a href=#Figure_8>Fig. 8</a>; the power of the “excited” blood to inhibit
the contractions of the intestinal muscle when record
<i>A</i> was written was destroyed after three
hours of exposure to bubbling oxygen, as shown
by record <i>B</i>. The destruction of adrenin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>
the disappearance of the effect which adrenin
would produce are thus closely parallel.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All these considerations, taken with the proof
that sympathetic impulses increase secretion of the
adrenal glands, and taken also with the evidence
that, during such emotional excitement as was employed
in these experiments, signs of sympathetic
discharges appeared throughout the animal from
the dilated pupil of the eye to the standing hairs
of the tail-tip, led us to the conclusions that the
characteristic action of adrenin on intestinal muscle
was in fact, in our experiments, due to secretion
of the adrenal glands, and that that secretion
is increased in great emotion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Evidence that Adrenal Secretion is Increased by
“Painful” Stimulation</span></h3>

<p>As mentioned in the first chapter, stimulation of
sensory fibres in one of the larger nerve trunks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span>
is known to result in such nervous discharges along
sympathetic paths as to produce marked inhibition
of digestive processes. Other manifestations
of sympathetic innervations&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, contraction of
arterioles, dilation of pupils, erection of hairs&mdash;are
also demonstrable. And since the adrenal
glands are stimulated to activity by sympathetic
impulses, it was possible that they would be affected
as are other structures supplied with sympathetic
fibres, and that they would secrete in
greater abundance when sensory nerves were irritated.</p>

<p>The testing of this possibility was undertaken by
Hoskins and myself in 1911. Since bodily changes
from “painful” stimulation can in large degree be
produced in an anesthetized animal, without, however,
an experience of pain by the animal, it was
possible to make the test quite simply. The sensory
stimulus was a rapidly interrupted induced
current applied to the sciatic nerve. The current
was increased in strength as time passed, and thus
the intensity of the effect, indicated by continuous
dilation of the pupils, was maintained. There was
no doubt that such stimulation would have caused
very severe pain if the animal had not been anesthetized.
Indeed, the stimulus used was probably
much stronger than would be necessary to obtain
a positive result in the absence of the anesthetic
(urethane), which markedly lessens the irritability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
of visceral nerve <span class="nowrap">fibres.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> In different instances
the stimulation lasted from three to six
minutes. Throughout the period there was markedly
increased rapidity and depth of breathing.</p>

<p>As <a href=#Figure_9>Fig. 9</a> shows, the normal blood, removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
from the vena cava before stimulation, caused no
inhibition of the beating segment, whereas that
removed afterwards produced a deep relaxation.
Hoskins and I showed that the increased respiration
which accompanies “painful” stimulation does
not augment adrenal activity. We concluded,
therefore, that when a sensory trunk is strongly
excited the adrenal glands are reflexly stimulated,
and that they pour into the blood stream an increased
amount of adrenin.</p>

solution substituted.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3><span class="smcap">Confirmation of Our Results by Other Observers</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing experiments and conclusions were
reported in 1911. In 1912, <span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> brought confirmatory
evidence by use of a method quite different
from ours. As previously stated, he studied
the effects of experimental procedures on adrenal
secretion by a careful comparative quantitative
assay of the adrenin content of the glands when
one gland was isolated from the central nervous
system and the other left connected. He took
advantage of the action of morphia and of the
substance Β-tetrahydronaphthylamine in evoking
in cats all the appearances of great fright. After
the animals had thus been “frightened,” he found
that the adrenal gland which was still connected
with the spinal cord was much depleted of its
adrenin content compared with the other, isolated
gland. And he observed, further, that animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
newly brought to the laboratory, and evidently
disturbed by the strangeness of their surroundings,
had a considerably smaller amount of adrenin in
their glands than other animals grown accustomed
to the situation. Elliott also observed that prolonged
excitation of a sensory nerve, such as the
great sciatic, may cause the adrenin largely to
disappear from the gland still connected with the
central nervous system and subjected, therefore, to
reflex influences.</p>

<p>Our conclusions have also been confirmed more
recently (1913) by Hitchings, Sloan and <span class="nowrap">Austin,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
working in Crile’s laboratory in Cleveland. They
used the same method which we had used to obtain
blood and to test for adrenin, and found that
after great fear and rage had been induced in a
cat by the attempt of a muzzled dog to fight it,
the adrenin reaction was clearly demonstrable.
And just as we had noted that the reaction did not
occur if the adrenal glands had been removed, they
showed that it did not occur if the nervous connections
with the spinal cord were previously severed.</p>

<p>The logic of all these experiments may be briefly
summed up. That the adrenal glands are subject
to splanchnic influence has been demonstrated
anatomically and by the physiological effects of
their secretion after artificial stimulation of the
splanchnic nerves. Impulses are normally sent
along these nerves, in the natural conditions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>
life, when animals become greatly excited, as in
fear and rage and pain. There is every probability,
therefore, that these glands are stimulated to
extra secretion at such times. Both by an exceedingly
delicate biological test (intestinal muscle)
and by an examination of the glands themselves,
clear evidence has been secured that in pain
and deep emotion the glands do, in fact, pour out
an excess of adrenin into the circulating blood.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a remarkable group of phenomena&mdash;a
pair of glands stimulated to activity in times
of strong excitement and by such nerve impulses
as themselves produce at such times profound
changes in the viscera; and a secretion given forth
into the blood stream by these glands, which is
capable of inducing by itself, or of augmenting,
the nervous influences which induce the very
changes in the viscera which accompany suffering
and the major emotions. What may be the significance
of these changes, occurring when conditions
of pain and great excitement&mdash;experiences
common to animals of most diverse types and
probably known to their ancestors for ages past&mdash;lay
hold of the bodily functions and determine
the instinctive responses?</p>

<p>Certain remarkable effects of injecting adrenin
into the blood have for many years been more or
less well recognized. For example, when injected
it causes liberation of sugar from the liver into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>
the blood stream. It relaxes the smooth muscle
of the bronchioles. Some old experiments indicated
that it acts as an antidote for muscular
fatigue. It alters the distribution of the blood in
the body, driving it from the abdominal viscera
into the heart, lungs, central nervous system and
limbs. And there was some evidence that it renders
more rapid the coagulation of the blood.
There may be other activities of adrenin not yet
discovered&mdash;it may coöperate with the products
of other glands of internal secretion. And other
glands of internal secretion may be stimulated by
sympathetic impulses. But we were not concerned
with these possibilities. We wished to know
whether the adrenin poured out in pain and emotional
excitement produced or helped to produce
the same effects that follow the injection of adrenin.
Our later researches were concerned with answers
to this question.</p>

<p class="center">THE INCREASE OF BLOOD SUGAR IN PAIN
AND GREAT EMOTION</p>


<p class="sp2">Sugar is the form in which carbohydrate material
is transported in organisms; starch is the storage
form. In the bodies of animals that have
been well fed the liver contains an abundance of
glycogen or “animal starch,” which may be called
upon in times of need. At such times the glycogen
is changed, and set free in the blood as sugar.
Ordinarily there is a small percentage of sugar
in the blood&mdash;from 0.06 to 0.1 per cent. When
only this small amount is present the kidneys are
capable of preventing its escape in any noteworthy
amount. If the percentage rises to the neighborhood
of 0.2&ndash;0.3 per cent, however, the sugar passes
the obstacle set up by the kidneys, and is readily
demonstrable in the urine by ordinary tests. The
condition of “glycosuria,” therefore, may properly
be considered, in certain circumstances, as
evidence of increased sugar in the blood. The injection
of adrenin can liberate sugar from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span>
liver to such an extent that glycosuria results.
Does the adrenal secretion discharged in pain and
strong emotional excitement play a rôle in producing
glycosuria under such conditions?</p>

<p>In clinical literature scattered suggestions are
to be found that conditions giving rise to emotional
states may be the occasion also of more or
less permanent glycosuria. Great grief and prolonged
anxiety during a momentous crisis have
been regarded as causes of individual instances
of diabetes, and anger or fright has been followed
by an increase in the sugar excreted by persons
who already have the disease. <span class="nowrap">Kleen<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> cites
the instance of a German officer whose diabetes
and whose Iron Cross for valor both came from
a stressful experience in the Franco-Prussian War.
The onset of the disease in a man directly after
his wife was discovered in adultery is described
by <span class="nowrap">Naunyn;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> and this author also mentions
two cases in his own practice&mdash;one started during
the bombardment of Strassburg (1870), the other
started a few days after a companion had shot
himself. In cases of mental disease, also, states
of depression have been described accompanied
by sugar in the urine. <span class="nowrap">Schultze<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> has reported
that in these cases the amount of glycosuria is dependent
on the degree of depression, and that the
greatest excretion of sugar occurs in the fear-psychoses.
<span class="nowrap">Raimann<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> has reported that in both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span>
melancholia and mania the assimilation limit of
sugar may be lowered. Similar results in the
insane have recently been presented by <span class="nowrap">Mita,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
and by Folin and <span class="nowrap">Denis.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> The latter investigators
found glycosuria in 12 per cent of 192 insane
patients, most of whom suffered from depression,
apprehension, or excitement. And <span class="nowrap">Arndt<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> has
observed glycosuria appearing and disappearing
as alcoholic delirium appeared and disappeared in
his patients.</p>

<p>Although clinical evidence thus indicates an
emotional origin of some cases of diabetes and
glycosuria, the intricacies of existence and the
complications of disease in human beings throw
some doubt on the value of that evidence. Both
<span class="nowrap">Naunyn<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> and Hirschfeld, although mentioning
instances of diabetes apparently due to an emotional
experience, urge a skeptical attitude toward
such statements. It is desirable, therefore,
that the question of an emotional glycosuria be
tested under simpler and more controllable conditions.
“Emotional glycosuria” in experimental
animals has indeed been referred to by Waterman
and <span class="nowrap">Smit<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> and more recently by Henderson
and <span class="nowrap">Underhill.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> Both these references, however,
are based on the work of Böhm and <span class="nowrap">Hoffmann,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
reported in 1878.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glycosuria From Pain</span></h3>

<p>Böhm and Hoffmann found that cats, when
bound to an operating board, a tube inserted into
the trachea (without anesthesia), and in some
instances a catheter inserted into the urethra
through an opening above the pubis, had in about
half an hour an abundance of sugar in the urine.
In three determinations sugar in the blood proved
slightly above “normal” so long as sugar was appearing
in the urine, but returned to “normal”
as the glycosuria disappeared. Since they were
able to produce the phenomenon by simply binding
animals to the holder, they called it “Fesselungsdiabetes.”</p>

<p>As possible causes of this glycosuria in bound
animals, they considered opening the trachea,
cooling, and pain. The first two they readily
eliminated, and still they found sugar excreted.
Pain they could not obviate, and since, without
binding the animals, they caused glycosuria by
merely stimulating the sciatic nerves, they concluded
that painful confinement was itself a sufficient
cause. Other factors, however, such as cooling
and circulatory disturbances, probably coöperated
with pain, they believed, to produce the
result. Their observations on cats have been
proved true also of <span class="nowrap">rabbits;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> and recently it has
been shown that an operation involving some pain
increases blood sugar in <span class="nowrap">dogs.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> Temporary glycosuria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>
has likewise been noted in association with
intense pain in human beings.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Böhm and Hoffmann did not mention
the emotional element in discussing their results,
and inasmuch as they admitted that they
could not obviate from their experimental procedure
pain, which they themselves proved was
effective in causing glycosuria, designating what
they called “Fesselungsdiabetes” as “emotional
glycosuria” is not justified.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emotional Glycosuria</span></h3>

<p>The discovery that during strong emotion adrenal
secretion is increased, and the fact that injection
of adrenin gives rise to glycosuria, suggested
that glycosuria might be called forth by emotional
excitement, and then that even without the painful
element of Böhm and Hoffmann’s experiments,
sugar might be found in the urine. The testing of
this possibility was undertaken by A.&nbsp;T. Shohl, W.&nbsp;S.
Wright and myself in 1911.</p>

<p>Our first procedure was a repetition of Böhm
and Hoffmann’s experiments, freed from the
factor of pain. The animals (cats) were bound
to a comfortable holder, which left the head
unfastened. This holder I had used hundreds
of times in X-ray studies of digestion, with
many different animals, without causing any signs
of even so much as uneasiness. Just as in observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span>
on the movements of the alimentary canal,
however, so here, the animals reacted differently
to the experience of being confined. Young males
usually became quite frantic, and with eyes wide,
pupils dilated, pulse accelerated, hairs of the tail
more or less erect, they struggled, snarling and
growling, to free themselves. Females, on the
contrary, especially if elderly, were as a rule
much more calm, and resignedly accepted the novel
situation.</p>

<p>According to differences in reaction the animals
were left in the holder for periods varying in
length from thirty minutes to five hours. In
order to insure prompt urination, considerable
quantities of water were given by stomach tube
at the beginning of the experiment and in some
cases again later. Arrangements were made for
draining the urine promptly, when the animal was
on the holder or when afterwards in a metal metabolism
cage, into a glass receiver containing a few
drops of chloroform to prevent fermentation.
The diet in all cases consisted of customary raw
meat and milk. In every instance the urine was
proved free from sugar before the animal was
excited.</p>

<p>In our series of observations twelve cats were
used, and in every one a well-marked glycosuria
was developed. The shortest periods of confinement
to the holder which were effective were thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>
and forty minutes; the longest we employed, five
hours. The average time required to bring about
a glycosuria was less than an hour and a half;
the average in seven of the twelve cases was less
than forty minutes. In all cases no sugar was
found in the urine passed on the day after the
excitement.</p>

<p>The promptness with which the glycosuria developed
was directly related to the emotional state
of the animal. Sugar was found early in animals
which early showed signs of being frightened
or in a rage, and much later in animals which took
the experience more calmly.</p>

<p>As cooling may result in increased sugar in the
blood, and consequent glycosuria, the rectal temperature
was observed from time to time, and it
was found to vary so slightly that in these experiments
it was a wholly negligible factor. In one
cat the rectal temperature fell to 36°&nbsp;C. while the
animal was bound and placed in a cold room (about
2°&nbsp;C.) for fifty minutes, but no sugar appeared in
the urine.</p>

<p>Further evidence that the appearance of sugar
in the urine may arise purely from emotional excitement
was obtained from three cats which gave
negative results when bound in the holder for
varying periods up to four hours. It was noteworthy
that these animals remained calm and
passive in their confinement. When, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
they were placed, separately, in a small wire cage,
and were barked at by an energetic little dog, that
jumped at them and made signs of attack, the cats
became much excited, they showed their teeth,
humped their backs, and growled defiance. This
sham fight was permitted to continue for a half
hour in each of the three cases. In each case the
animal, which after four hours of bondage had exhibited
no glycosuria, now had sugar in the urine.
Pain, cooling, and bondage were not factors in
these experiments. The animal was either frightened
or enraged by the barking dog, and that excitement
was attended by glycosuria.</p>

<p>The sugar excreted in the twenty-four hours
which included the period of excitement was determined
by the Bertrand <span class="nowrap">method.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> It ranged
from 0.024 gram to 1.93 grams, or from 0.008
gram to 0.62 gram per kilo body weight, for the
twenty-four hours’ quantity.</p>

<p>The presence of sugar in the urine may be used
as an indication of increased sugar in the blood,
for unless injury has been done to the cells of
the kidneys, they do not permit sugar to escape
until the percentage in the blood has risen to a
considerable degree. Thus, though testing the
urine reveals the instances of a high content of
blood sugar, it does not show the fine variations
that appear when the blood itself is examined.
Recently <span class="nowrap">Scott<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> has concluded a thorough investigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span>
of the variations of blood sugar in cats,
and has found that merely incidental conditions,
producing even mild excitement, as indicated by
crying or otherwise, result in a noticeable rise in
the amount. Indeed, so sensitive is the sugar-liberating
mechanism that all the early determinations
of the “normal” content of sugar in blood
which has been drawn from an artery or vein in
the absence of anesthesia, are of very doubtful
value. Certainly when care is taken to obtain
blood suddenly from a tranquil animal, the percentage
(0.069, Scott; 0.088, Pavy) is much less
than when the blood is drawn without anesthesia
(0.15, Böhm and Hoffmann), or after light narcosis
(0.282, Rona and <span class="nowrap">Takahashi<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>).</p>

<p>Our observations on cats have since been found
valid for rabbits. Rolly and Oppermann, Jacobsen,
and Hirsch and <span class="nowrap">Reinbach<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> have recently
recorded that the mere handling of a rabbit preparatory
to operating on it will increase the percentage
of blood sugar (in some cases from 0.10
to 0.23 and 0.27 per cent). Dogs are said to be
much less likely to be disturbed by the nature of
their surroundings than are rabbits and cats.
Nevertheless, pain and excitement are such fundamental
experiences in animals that without much
doubt the same mechanism is operative in all when
these experiences occur. Probably, just as the
digestion of dogs is disturbed by strong emotion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>
the blood sugar likewise is increased, for sympathetic
impulses occasion both <span class="nowrap">changes.<a id="SNanchor_5" href="#Starnote_5" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Gib
has given an account of a bitch that became much
agitated when shut up, and after such enforced
seclusion, but never otherwise, she excreted small
quantities of sugar in the <span class="nowrap">urine.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_5" href="#SNanchor_5" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Since the foregoing sentences were written Hirsch and
Reinbach have reported (Zeitschrift für physiologische
Chemie, 1914, <abbr title="91">xci</abbr>, p. 292) a “psychic hyperglycemia” in dogs,
that resulted from fastening the animals to a table. The
blood sugar rose in one instance from 0.11 to 0.14 per cent,
and in another from 0.09 to 0.16 per cent.</p>
</div>

<p>The results noted in these lower animals have
been confirmed in human beings. One of my former
students, W.&nbsp;G. Smillie, found that four of
nine medical students, all normally without sugar
in their urine, had glycosuria after a hard examination,
and only one of the nine had glycosuria
after an easier examination. The tests, which
were positive with Fehling’s solution, Nylander’s
reagent, and also with phenyl-hydrazine, were
made on the first urine passed after the examination.
Furthermore, C.&nbsp;H. Fiske and I examined
the urine of twenty-five members of
the Harvard University football squad immediately
after the final and most exciting contest
of the season of 1913, and found sugar in
twelve cases. Five of these positive cases
were among substitutes not called upon to enter
the game. The only excited spectator of the Harvard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
victory whose urine was examined also had
a marked glycosuria, which on the following day
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Other tests made on students before and after
important scholastic examinations have been published
by Folin, Denis and <span class="nowrap">Smillie.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> Of thirty-four
second-year medical students tested, one had
sugar before the examination as well as afterwards.
Of the remaining thirty-three, six, or 18
per cent, had small but unmistakable traces of
sugar in the urine passed directly following the
ordeal. A similar study was made on second-year
students at a women’s college. Of thirty-six students
who had no sugar in the urine on the day
before, six, or 17 per cent, eliminated sugar with
the urine passed immediately after the examination.</p>

<p>From the foregoing results it is reasonable to
conclude that just as in the cat, dog, and rabbit,
so also in man, emotional excitement produces temporary
increase of blood sugar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Rôle of the Adrenal Glands in Emotional
Glycosuria</span></h3>

<p>Since artificial stimulation of the splanchnic
nerves produces <span class="nowrap">glycosuria,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> and since major
emotions, such as rage and fright, are attended by
nervous discharges along splanchnic pathways,
glycosuria as an accompaniment of emotional excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>
would naturally be expected to occur.
To what extent the adrenal glands which, as
already mentioned, are stimulated to increased
secretion by excitement, might play a part in this
process, has been in dispute. Removal of these
glands or cutting of the nerve fibres supplying
them, according to some <span class="nowrap">observers,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span> prevents
glycosuria after puncture of the fourth ventricle
of the brain (the “sugar puncture,” which typically
induces glycosuria) and also after stimulation of
the <span class="nowrap">splanchnics.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> On the other hand, Wertheimer
and <span class="nowrap">Battez<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> have stated that removal
of the glands does not abolish the effects of sugar
puncture in the cat. It was questionable, therefore,
whether removal of the adrenal glands would
affect emotional glycosuria.</p>

<p>Evidence on this point I secured with Shohl and
Wright in observations on three animals in which
the adrenals were removed aseptically under ether.
The animals selected had all become quickly excited
on being bound to the holder, and had manifested
glycosuria after about an hour of confinement.
In the operation, to avoid discharge of
adrenin by handling, the adrenal veins were first
tied, and then the glands freed from their attachments
and removed as quickly and with as little
manipulation as possible. In one cat the entire
operation was finished in twenty minutes. In two
of the cats a small catheter was introduced into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>
urethra through an incision, so that the bladder
could be emptied at any time.</p>

<p>In all three cases urine that was free from
sugar was obtained soon after the operation. Although
the animals deprived of their adrenals
manifested a general lessening of muscular tone,
they still displayed much of their former rage or
excitement when bound. Indeed, one was more excited
after removal of the adrenals than before.
That the animals might not be excessively cooled
they were kept warm with coverings or an electric
heating pad. Although they were now bound
for periods from two to three times as long as
the periods required formerly to cause glycosuria,
no trace of sugar was found in the urine in any
instance. The evidence thus secured tends, therefore,
to support the view that the adrenal glands
perform an important contributory rôle in the
glycosuria resulting from splanchnic stimulation.</p>

<p>Possibly the emotional element is in part accountable
for the glycosuria observed after painful
stimulation, but conditions causing pain alone
will reasonably explain it. As we have already
seen, strong stimulation of sensory fibres causes
the discharge of impulses along the splanchnic
nerves, and incidentally calls forth an increased
secretion of the adrenal glands. In glycosuria resulting
from painful stimulation, as well as in emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>
glycosuria, the adrenal glands may be essential
factors.</p>

<p>Later the evidence will be given that sugar is
the optimum source of muscular energy. In passing,
we may note that the liberation of sugar at
a time when great muscular exertion is likely to
be demanded of the organism may be interpreted
as a highly interesting instance of biological
adaptation.</p>

<p class="center">IMPROVED CONTRACTION OF FATIGUED
MUSCLE AFTER SPLANCHNIC STIMULATION OF
THE ADRENAL GLAND</p>


<p class="sp2">In the older literature on the adrenal glands the
deleterious effect of their absence, or the beneficial
effect of injected extracts, on the contraction of
skeletal muscle was not infrequently noted. As
evidence accumulated, however, tending to prove
an important relation between the extract of the
adrenal medulla (adrenin) and the sympathetic
nervous system, the relations with the efficiency of
skeletal muscle began to receive less consideration.</p>

<p>The muscular weakness of persons suffering
from diseased adrenals (Addison’s disease) was
well recognized before experimental work on the
glands was begun. Experiments on rabbits were
reported in 1892 by <span class="nowrap">Albanese,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> who showed that
muscles which were stimulated after removal
of the glands were much more exhausted than
when stimulated the same length of time in the
same animal before the removal. Similarly Boinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
reported, in 1895, that rats recently deprived
of their adrenals were much more quickly exhausted
in a revolving cage than were normal
animals.</p>

<p>More direct evidence of the favorable influence
of adrenal extract on skeletal muscle was brought
forward by Oliver and <span class="nowrap">Schäfer.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> After injecting
the extract subcutaneously into a frog they
found that the excised gastrocnemius muscle registered
a curve of contraction about 33 per cent
higher and about 66 per cent longer than the
corresponding muscle not exposed to the action
of the extract. Similar prolongation of the muscle
curve was observed after injecting the extract
intravenously into a dog. A beneficial effect
of adrenal extract on fatigued muscle, even when
applied to the solution in which the isolated
muscle was contracting, was claimed by Dessy
and <span class="nowrap">Grandis,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> who studied the phenomenon in a
<span class="nowrap">salamander.<a id="SNanchor_6" href="#Starnote_6" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Further evidence leading to the
same conclusion was offered in a discriminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span>
paper by <span class="nowrap">Panella.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> He found that in cold-blooded
animals the active principle of the adrenal
medulla notably reënforced skeletal muscle,
prolonging its ability to do work, and improving
its contraction when fatigued. In warm-blooded
animals the same effects were observed,
but only after certain experimental procedures,
such as anesthesia and section of the bulb, had
changed them to a condition resembling the cold-blooded.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_6" href="#SNanchor_6" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  These earlier investigations, in which an extract of
the entire gland was used, made no distinction between the
action of the medulla and that of the cortex. It may be that
the weakness following removal or disease of the adrenals is
due to absence of the cortex (see Hoskins and Wheelon: American
Journal of Physiology, 1914, <abbr title="34">xxxiv</abbr>, p. 184). Such a
possible effect, however, should not be confused with the
demonstrable influence of injected adrenin (derived from the
adrenal medulla alone) and the similar effects from adrenal
secretion caused by splanchnic stimulation.</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing evidence indicates that removal
of the adrenals has a debilitating effect on muscular
power, and that injection of extracts of the
glands has an invigorating effect. It seemed possible,
therefore, that increased secretion of the
adrenal glands, whether from direct stimulation
of the splanchnic nerves or as a reflex result of
pain or the major emotions, might act as a dynamogenic
factor in the performance of muscular
work. With this possibility in mind L.&nbsp;B. Nice
and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> first concerned ourselves in a research
which we conducted in 1912.</p>

<p>The general plan of the investigation consisted
primarily in observing the effect of stimulating
the splanchnic nerves, isolated from the spinal
cord, on the contraction of a muscle whose nerve,
also isolated from the spinal cord, was rhythmically
and uniformly excited with break induction
shocks. When a muscle is thus stimulated it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>
at first responds by strong contractions, but as
time passes the contractions become weaker, the
degree of shortening of the muscle becomes less,
and in this state of lessened efficiency it may continue
for a long period to do work. The tired
muscle which is showing continuously and evenly
its inability to respond as it did at first, is said to
have reached the “fatigue level.” This level serves
as an excellent basis for testing influences that
may have a beneficial effect on muscular performance,
for the benefit is at once manifested in
greater contraction.</p>

<p>In the experimental arrangement which we used,
only a connection through the circulating blood
existed between the splanchnic region and the
muscle&mdash;all nervous relations were severed. Any
change in muscular ability, therefore, occurring
when the splanchnic nerve is stimulated, must
be due to an alteration in the quantity or quality
of the blood supplied to the laboring
muscle.</p>

<p>Cats were used for most experiments, but results
obtained with cats were confirmed on rabbits
and dogs. To produce anesthesia in the
cats and rabbits, and at the same time to avoid
the fluctuating effects of ether, urethane (2 grams
per kilo body weight) was given by a stomach tube.
The animals were fastened back downward, over
an electric warming pad, to an animal holder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
Care was taken to maintain the body temperature
at its normal level throughout each experiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Nerve-muscle Preparation</span></h3>

<p>The muscle selected to be fatigued was usually
the extensor of the right hind foot (the <i lang="la">tibialis
anticus</i>), though at times the common extensor
muscle of the digits of the same foot was employed.
The anterior tibial nerve which supplies
these muscles was bared for about two centimeters,
severed toward the body, and set in shielded electrodes,
around which the skin was fastened by
spring clips. Thus the nerve could be protected,
kept moist, and stimulated without stimulation of
neighboring structures. By a small slit in the skin
the tendon of the muscle was uncovered, and after
a strong thread was tied tightly about it, it was
separated from its insertion. A nerve-muscle
preparation was thereby made which was still connected
with its proper blood supply. The preparation
was fixed firmly to the animal holder by
thongs looped around the hock and the foot, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>,
on either side of the slit through which the tendon
emerged.</p>

<p>The thread tied to the tendon was passed over
a pulley and down to a pivoted steel bar which
bore a writing point. Both the pulley and this
steel writing lever were supported in a rigid tripod.
In the earliest experiments the contracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span>
muscle was made to lift weights (125 to 175
grams); in all the later observations, however,
the muscle pulled against a spring attached below
the steel bar. The tension of the spring as the
muscle began to lift the lever away from the support
was, in most of the experiments, 110 grams,
with an increase of 10 grams as the writing point
was raised 4.5 millimeters. The magnification of
the lever was 3.8.</p>

<p>The stimuli delivered to the anterior tibial nerve
were, in most experiments, single break shocks of
a value barely maximal when applied to the fresh
preparation. The rate of stimulation varied between
60 and 300 per minute, but was uniform
in any single observation. A rate which was found
generally serviceable was 180 per minute.</p>

<p>Since the anterior tibial nerve contains fibres
affecting blood vessels, as well as fibres causing
contraction of skeletal muscle, the possibility had
to be considered that stimuli applied to it might
disturb the blood supply of the region. Constriction
of the blood vessels would be likely to produce
the most serious disturbance, by lessening
the blood flow to the muscle. The observations
of Bowditch and <span class="nowrap">Warren,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> that vasodilator rather
than vasoconstrictor effects are produced by
single induction shocks repeated at intervals of
not more than five per second, reassured us as to
the danger of diminishing the blood supply, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span>
the rate of stimulation in our experiments never
exceeded five per second and was usually two or
three. Furthermore, in using these different rates
we have never noted any result which could reasonably
be attributed to a diminished circulation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Splanchnic Preparation</span></h3>

<p>The splanchnic nerves were stimulated in various
ways. At first only the left splanchnics in
the abdomen were prepared. The nerves, separated
from the spinal cord, were placed upon
shielded electrodes. The form of electrodes which
was found most satisfactory was that illustrated
in <a href=#Figure_10>Fig. 10</a>. The instrument was made of a round
rod of hard wood, bevelled to a point at one end,
and grooved on the two sides. Into the grooves
were pressed insulated wires ending in platinum
hooks, which projected beyond the bevelled surface.
Around the rod was placed an insulating
rubber tube which was cut out so as to leave the
hooks uncovered when the tube was slipped downward.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_10">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig10.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 10.</span>&mdash;The shielded electrodes used in stimulating the
splanchnic nerves. For description see text.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In applying the electrodes the left splanchnic
nerves were first freed from their surroundings
and tightly ligatured as close as possible to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>
origin. By means of strong compression the conductivity
of the nerves was destroyed central
to the ligature. The electrodes were now fixed
in place by thrusting the sharp end of the wooden
rod into the muscles of the back. This was so
done as to bring the platinum hooks a few millimeters
above the nerves. With a small seeker
the nerves were next gently lifted over the hooks,
and then the rubber tube was slipped downward
until it came in contact with the body wall. Absorbent
cotton was packed about the lower end
of the electrodes, to take up any fluid that might
appear; and finally the belly wall was closed with
spring clips. The rubber tube served to keep the
platinum hooks from contact with the muscles of
the back and the movable viscera, while still permitting
access to the nerves which were to be
stimulated. This stimulating apparatus could be
quickly applied, and, once in place, needed no
further attention. In some of the experiments
both splanchnic nerves were stimulated in
the thorax. The rubber-covered electrode proved
quite as serviceable there as in the abdomen.</p>

<p>The current delivered to the splanchnic nerves
was a rapidly interrupted induced current of such
strength that no effects of spreading were noticeable.
That splanchnic stimulation causes secretion
of the adrenal glands has been proved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span>
many different ways which have already been described
(see <a href=#Page_41>p. 41</a>).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Effects of Splanchnic Stimulation on the
Contraction of Fatigued Muscle</span></h3>

<p>When skeletal muscle is repeatedly stimulated
by a long series of rapidly recurring electric
shocks, its strong contractions gradually grow
weaker until a fairly constant condition is reached.
The record then has an even top&mdash;the muscle has
reached the “fatigue level.” The effect of splanchnic
stimulation was tried when the muscle had
been fatigued to this stage. The effect which was
often obtained by stimulating the left splanchnic
nerves is shown in <a href=#Figure_11>Fig. 11</a>. In this instance the
muscle while relaxed supported no weight, and
while contracting lifted a weight of 125 grams.
The rate of stimulation was 80 per minute.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_11">
  <img class="w80" src="images/fig11.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 11.</span>&mdash;Upper record, contraction of the <i lang="la">tibialis
anticus</i>, 80 times a minute, lifting a weight of 125 grams.
Lower record, stimulation of the left splanchnic nerves,
two minutes. Time, half minutes.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span></p>

<p>The muscle record shows a brief initial rise
from the fatigue level, followed by a drop, and
that in turn by another, prolonged rise. The maximum
height of the record is 13.5 millimeters, an
increase of 6 millimeters over the height recorded
before splanchnic stimulation. Thus the muscle
was performing for a short period 80 per cent
more work than before splanchnic stimulation, and
for a considerably longer period exhibited an intermediate
betterment of its efficiency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The First Rise in the Muscle Record</span></h3>

<p>The brief first elevation in the muscle record
when registered simultaneously with arterial blood
pressure is observed to occur at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>
with the sharp initial rise in the blood-pressure
curve (see <a href=#Figure_12>Fig. 12</a>). The first sharp rise in blood
pressure is due to contraction of the vessels in
the area of distribution of the splanchnic nerves,
for it does not appear if the alimentary canal is
removed, or if the celiac axis and the superior
and inferior mesenteric arteries are ligated. The
betterment of the muscular contraction is probably
due directly to the better blood supply resulting
from the increased pressure, for if the adrenal
veins are clipped and the splanchnic nerves are
stimulated, the blood pressure rises as before and
at the same time there may be registered a higher
contraction of the muscle.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_12">
  <img class="w80" src="images/fig12.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 12.</span>&mdash;Top record, arterial blood
pressure with membrane manometer. Middle

loaded with 125 grams and stimulated 80
times a minute. Bottom record, splanchnic
stimulation (two minutes). Time, half minutes.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Prolonged Rise in the Muscle Record</span></h3>

<p>As <a href=#Figure_12>Fig. 12</a> shows, the initial quick uplift in the
blood-pressure record is quickly checked by a drop.
This rapid drop does not appear when the adrenal
veins are obstructed. A similar difference in
blood-pressure records has been noted before and
after excision of the adrenal glands. As <span class="nowrap">Elliott,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
and as Lyman and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> have shown, this
sharp drop after the first rise, and also the subsequent
elevation of blood pressure, are the consequences
of liberation of adrenal secretion into the
circulation. <a href=#Figure_12>Fig. 12</a> demonstrates that the prolonged
rise of the muscle record begins soon after
this characteristic drop in blood pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span></p>

<p>If after clips have been placed on the adrenal
veins so that no blood passes from them, the
splanchnic nerves are stimulated, and later the
clips are removed, a slight but distinct improvement
in the muscular contraction occurs. As in
the experiments of Young and <span class="nowrap">Lehmann,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> in
which the adrenal veins were tied for a time and
then released, the release of the blood which had
been pent in these veins was quickly followed by
a rise of blood pressure. The volume of blood
thus restored to circulation was too slight to account
for the rise of pressure. In conjunction
with the evidence that splanchnic stimulation calls
forth adrenal secretion, the rise may reasonably be
attributed to that secretion. The fact should be
noted, however, that in this instance the prolonged
improvement in muscular contraction did not appear
until the adrenal secretion had been admitted
to the general circulation.</p>

<p>Many variations in the improvement of activity
in fatigued muscle after splanchnic stimulation
were noted in the course of our investigation. The
improvement varied in degree, as indicated by increased
height of the record. In some instances
the height of contraction was doubled&mdash;a betterment
by 100 per cent; in other instances the contraction
after splanchnic stimulation was only a
small fraction higher than that preceding the stimulation;
and in still other instances there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>
betterment whatever. Never, in our experience,
were the augmented contractions equal to the
original strong contractions of the fresh muscle.</p>

<p>The improvement also varied in degree as indicated
by persistence of effect. In some instances
the muscle returned to its former working
level within four or five minutes after splanchnic
stimulation ceased (see <a href=#Figure_11>Fig. 11</a>); and in other cases
the muscle continued working with greater efficiency
for fifteen or twenty minutes after the stimulation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Two Factors: Arterial Pressure and Adrenal
Secretion</span></h3>

<p>The evidence just presented has shown that
splanchnic stimulation improves the contraction of
fatigued muscle. Splanchnic stimulation, however,
has two effects&mdash;it increases general arterial pressure
and it also causes a discharge of adrenin from
the adrenal glands. The questions now arise&mdash;Does
splanchnic stimulation produce the improvement
in muscular contraction by increasing the
arterial blood pressure and thereby flushing the
laboring muscles with fresh blood? Or does the
adrenin liberated by splanchnic stimulation act
itself, specifically, to improve the muscular contraction?
Or may the two factors coöperate?
These questions will be dealt with in the next two
chapters.</p>

<p class="center">THE EFFECTS ON CONTRACTION OF FATIGUED
MUSCLE OF VARYING THE ARTERIAL
BLOOD PRESSURE</p>


<p class="sp2">That great excitement is accompanied by sympathetic
innervations which increase the contraction
of the small arteries, render unusually forcible
the heart beat, and consequently raise arterial
pressure, has already been pointed out (see <a href=#Page_26>p. 26</a>).
Indeed, the counsel to avoid circumstances likely
to lead to such excitement, which is given to persons
with hardened arteries or with weak hearts,
is based on the liability of serious consequences,
either in the heart or in the vessels, that might
arise from an emotional increase of pressure in
these pathological conditions. That great muscular
effort also is accompanied by heightened arterial
pressure is equally well known, and is avoided
by persons likely to be injured by it. Both in excitement
and in strong exertion the blood is forced
in large degree from the capacious vessels of the
abdomen into other parts of the body. In excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>
the abdominal arteries and veins are contracted
by impulses from the splanchnic nerves.
In violent effort the diaphragm and the muscles
of the belly wall are voluntarily and antagonistically
contracted in order to stiffen the trunk as a
support for the arms; and the increased abdominal
pressure which results forces blood out of that
region and does not permit reaccumulation. The
general arterial pressure in man, as <span class="nowrap">McCurdy<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
has shown, may suddenly rise during extreme
physical effort, from approximately 110 millimeters
to 180 millimeters of mercury.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Effect of Increasing Arterial Pressure</span></h3>

<p>What effect the increase of arterial pressure, resulting
from excitement or physical strain, may
have on muscular efficiency, has received only
slight consideration. Nice and I found there was
need of careful study of the relations between
arterial pressure and muscular ability, and, in
1913, one of my students, C.&nbsp;M. Gruber, undertook
to make clearer these relations.</p>

<p>The methods of anesthesia and stimulation used
by Gruber were similar to those described in
the last chapter. The arterial blood pressure was
registered from the right carotid or the femoral
artery by means of a mercury manometer. A
time marker indicating half-minute intervals was
placed at the atmospheric pressure level of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
manometer. And since the blood-pressure style,
the writing point of the muscle lever, and the time
signal were all set in a vertical line on the surface
of the recording drum, at any given muscular contraction
the height of blood pressure was simultaneously
registered.</p>

<p>To increase general arterial pressure two methods
were used: the spinal cord was stimulated in
the cervical region through platinum electrodes, or
the left splanchnic nerves were stimulated after
the left adrenal gland had been excluded from the
circulation. This was done in order to avoid any
influence which adrenal secretion might exert. It
is assumed in these experiments that vessels supplying
active muscles would be actively dilated, as
<span class="nowrap">Kaufmann<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> has shown, and would, therefore, in
case of a general increase of blood pressure, deliver
a larger volume of blood to the area they
supply. The effects of increased arterial pressure
are illustrated in Figs. 13, 14 and 15. In the experiment
represented in <a href=#Figure_13>Fig. 13</a>, the rise of blood
pressure was produced by stimulation of the cervical
cord, and in <a href=#Figure_14>Figs. 14</a> and <a href=#Figure_15>15</a> by stimulation
of the left splanchnic nerves after the left adrenal
gland had been tied off.</p>

<p>The original blood pressure in <a href=#Figure_13>Fig. 13</a> was 120
millimeters of mercury. This was increased by
62 millimeters, with a rise of only 8.4 per cent in
the height of contraction of the fatigued muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span></p>

spinal cord was stimulated.

</figure>

<p>In <a href=#Figure_14>Fig. 14</a> the original blood pressure was 100
millimeters of mercury. By increasing this pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>
32 millimeters there resulted simultaneous
betterment of 9.8 per cent in the height of muscular
contraction. In Fig. 14 B the arterial pressure
was raised 26 millimeters and the height of
contraction increased correspondingly 7 per cent.
In Fig. 14 C no appreciable betterment can be seen
although the blood pressure rose 18 millimeters.</p>

<p>In <a href=#Figure_15>Fig. 15</a> the original blood pressure was low&mdash;68
millimeters of mercury. This was increased
in Fig. 15 A by 18 millimeters (the same as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
<a href=#Figure_14>Fig. 14</a> C without effect), and there resulted an increase
of 20 per cent in the height of contraction.
In Fig. 15 B the pressure was raised 24 millimeters
with a corresponding increase of 90 per cent
in the muscular contraction; and in Fig. 15 C 30
millimeters with a betterment of 125 per cent.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Comparison of Figs. 13, 14 and 15 reveals that
the improvement of contraction of fatigued muscle
is much greater when the blood pressure is
raised, even slightly, from a low level, than when
it is raised, perhaps to a very marked degree,
from a high level. In one of the experiments performed
by Nice and myself the arterial pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>
was increased by splanchnic stimulation from the
low level of 48 millimeters of mercury to 110 millimeters,
and the height of the muscular contractions
was increased about sixfold (see <a href=#Figure_16>Fig. 16</a>).</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_16">
  <img class="w70" src="images/fig16.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 16.</span>&mdash;The bottom record (zero of blood pressure) shows
stimulation of left splanchnics; between the arrows the pressure was
kept from rising by compression of heart.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Results confirming those described above were
obtained by Gruber in a study of the effects of
splanchnic stimulation on the irritability of muscle
when fatigued. In a series of eleven observations
the average value of the barely effective
stimulus (the “threshold” stimulus) had to be increased
as the condition of fatigue developed. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>
was increased for the nerve-muscle by 25 per cent
and for the muscle by 75 per cent. The left
splanchnic nerves, disconnected from the left adrenal
gland, were now stimulated. The arterial pressure,
which had varied between 90 and 100 millimeters
of mercury, was raised at least 40 millimeters.
As a result of splanchnic stimulation
there was an average recovery of 42 per cent in
the nerve-muscle and of 46 per cent in the muscle.
The increased general blood pressure was effective,
therefore, quite apart from any possible
action of adrenal secretion, in largely restoring to
the fatigued structures their normal irritability.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Effect of Decreasing Arterial Pressure</span></h3>

<p>Inasmuch as an increase in arterial pressure
produces an increase in the height of contraction
of fatigued muscle, it is readily supposable that
a decrease in the pressure would have the opposite
effect. Such is the case only when the blood
pressure falls below the region of 90 to 100 millimeters
of mercury. Thus if the arterial pressure
stands at 150 millimeters of mercury, it has to
fall approximately 55 to 65 millimeters before
causing a decrease in the height of contraction.
<a href=#Figure_17>Fig. 17</a> is the record of an experiment in which
the blood pressure was lowered by lessening the
output of blood from the heart by compressing the
thorax. The record shows that when the pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
was lowered from 120 to 100 millimeters of mercury
(A), there was no appreciable decrease in
the height of contraction; when lowered to 90
millimeters (B), there resulted a decrease of 2.4
per cent; when to 80 millimeters of mercury (C),
a decrease of 7 per cent; and when to 70 millimeters
(D), a decrease of 17.3 per cent. Results
similar to those represented in <a href=#Figure_17>Fig. 17</a> were obtained
by pulling on a string looped about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>
aorta just above its iliac branches, thus lessening
the flow to the hind limbs.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_17">
  <img class="w80" src="images/fig17.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 17.</span>&mdash;The arrows indicate the points at which the thorax
began to be compressed in order to lessen the output of blood
from the heart.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The region of 90 to 100 millimeters of mercury
may therefore be regarded as the <em>critical region</em>
at which a falling blood pressure begins to be accompanied
by a concurrent lessening of the efficiency
of muscular contraction, when the muscle
is kept in continued activity. It is at that region
that the blood flow is dangerously near to being
inadequate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Explanation of the Effects of Varying the Arterial
Pressure</span></h3>

<p>How are these effects of increasing and decreasing
the arterial blood pressure most reasonably
explained? There is abundant evidence that fatigue
products accumulate in a muscle which is
doing work, and also that these metabolites interfere
with efficient contraction. As <span class="nowrap">Ranke<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> long
ago demonstrated, if a muscle, deprived of circulating
blood, is fatigued to a standstill, and then
the circulation is restored, the muscle again responds
for a short time to stimulation, because
the waste has been neutralized or swept away by
the fresh blood. When the blood pressure is at
its normal height for warm-blooded animals
(about 120 millimeters of mercury, see <a href=#Figure_13>Fig. 13</a>),
the flow appears to be adequate to wash out the
depressive metabolites, at least in the single muscle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span>
used in these experiments, because a large rise of
pressure produces but little change in the fatigue
level. On the other hand, when the pressure is
abnormally low, the flow is inadequate, and the
waste products are permitted to accumulate and
clog the action of the muscle. Under such circumstances
a rise of pressure has a very striking beneficial
effect.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the best results of adrenin
on fatigued muscle reported by previous observers
were obtained from studies on cold-blooded
animals. In these animals the circulation is maintained
normally by an arterial pressure about one-third
that of warm-blooded animals. Injection of
adrenin in an amount which would not shut off the
blood supply would, by greatly raising the arterial
pressure, markedly increase the circulation of
blood in the active muscle. In short, the conditions
in cold-blooded animals are quite like those in the
pithed mammal with an arterial pressure of about
50 millimeters of mercury (see <a href=#Figure_16>Fig. 16</a>). Under
these conditions the improved circulation causes
a remarkable recovery from fatigue. That notable
results of adrenin on fatigue are observed in
warm-blooded animals only when they are deeply
anesthetized or are deprived of the medulla was
claimed by <span class="nowrap">Panella.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> He apparently believed
that in normal mammalian conditions adrenin has
little effect because quickly destroyed, whereas in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>
the cold-blooded animals, and in mammals whose
respiratory, circulatory, and thermogenic states
are made similar to the cold-blooded by anesthesia
or pithing, the contrary is true. In accordance
with our observations of the effects of blood pressure
on fatigued muscle, we would explain Panella’s
results not as he has done but as due to two
factors. First, the efficiency of the muscle, when
blood pressure is low, follows the ups and downs
of pressure much more directly than when the
pressure is high. And second, a given dose of
adrenin always raises a low blood pressure in
atonic vessels. The improvement of circulation
is capable of explaining, therefore, the main results
obtained in cold-blooded animals and in
pithed mammals.</p>

<p>Oliver and Schäfer reported unusually effective
contractions in muscles removed from the body
after adrenal extract had been injected. As shown
in <a href=#Figure_16>Fig. 16</a>, however, the fact that the circulation
<em>had been</em> improved results in continued greater efficiency
of the contracting muscle. Oliver and Schäfer’s
observation may reasonably be accounted for
on this basis.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Value of Increased Arterial Pressure in Pain and
Strong Emotion</span></h3>

<p>As stated in a previous paragraph, there is evidence
that the vessels supplying a muscle dilate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>
when the muscle becomes active. And although
the normal blood pressure (about 120 millimeters
of mercury) may be able to keep adequately supplied
with blood the single muscle used in our investigation,
a higher pressure might be required
when more muscles are involved in activity, for
a more widely spread dilation might then reduce
the pressure to the point at which there would be
insufficient circulation in active organs. Furthermore,
with many muscles active, the amount of
waste would be greatly augmented, and the need
for abundant blood supply would thereby to a
like degree be increased. For both reasons a rise
of general arterial pressure would prove advantageous.
The high pressure developed in excitement
and pain, therefore, might be specially serviceable
in the muscular activities which are likely
to accompany excitement and pain.</p>

<p>In connection with the foregoing considerations,
the action of adrenin on the distribution of blood
in the body is highly interesting. By measuring
alterations in the volume of various viscera and
the limbs, Oliver and <span class="nowrap">Schäfer<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> proved that the
viscera of the splanchnic area&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, the spleen,
the kidneys, and the intestines&mdash;suffer a considerable
decrease of volume when adrenin is administered,
whereas the limbs into which the blood is
forced from the splanchnic region actually increase
in size. The action of adrenin indicates the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
relative degrees of sympathetic innervations. In
other words, at times of pain and excitement sympathetic
discharges, probably aided by the adrenal
secretion simultaneously liberated, will drive the
blood out of the vegetative organs of the interior,
which serve the routine needs of the body, into
the skeletal muscles which have to meet by extra
action the urgent demands of struggle or escape.</p>

<p>But there are exceptions to the general statement
that by adrenin the viscera are emptied of
their blood. It is well known that adrenin has a
vasodilator, not a vasoconstrictor, action on the
arteries of the heart; it is well known also that
adrenin affects the vessels of the brain and the
lungs only slightly if at all. From this evidence
we may infer that sympathetic impulses, though
causing constriction of the arteries of the abdominal
viscera, have no effective influence on those of
the pulmonary and intracranial areas and actually
increase the blood supply to the heart. Thus the
absolutely and immediately essential organs&mdash;those
the ancients called the “tripod of life”&mdash;the
heart, the lungs, the brain (as well as its instruments,
the skeletal muscles)&mdash;are in times of excitement
abundantly supplied with blood taken
from organs of less importance in critical moments.
This shifting of the blood so that there is
an assured adequate supply to structures essential
for the preservation of the individual may reasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>
be interpreted as a fact of prime biological
significance. It will be placed in its proper setting
when the other evidence of bodily changes in pain
and excitement have been presented.</p>

<p class="center">THE SPECIFIC RÔLE OF ADRENIN IN
COUNTERACTING THE EFFECTS OF FATIGUE</p>


<p class="sp2">As a muscle approaches its fatigue level, its contractions
are decreased in height. Higher contractions
will again be elicited if the stimulus is increased.
Although these phenomena are well
known, no adequate analysis of their causes has
been advanced. A number of factors are probably
operative in decreasing the height of contraction:
(1) The using up of available energy-producing
material; (2) the accumulation of metabolites in
the fatigued muscle; (3) polarization of the nerve
at the point of repeated electrical stimulation; and
(4) a decrease of irritability. It may be that there
are interactions between these factors within the
muscle, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, the second may cause the fourth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Variations of the Threshold Stimulus as a Measure of
Irritability</span></h3>

<p>The last of the factors mentioned above&mdash;the
effect of fatigue on the irritability of the nerve-muscle
combination, or on the muscle alone&mdash;can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
be tested by determining variations in the least
stimulus capable of causing the slightest contraction,
the so-called “threshold stimulus.” As the
irritability lessens, the threshold stimulus must
necessarily be higher. The height of the threshold
is therefore a measure of irritability. How does
fatigue affect the irritability of nerve-muscle and
muscle? How is the irritability of fatigued structures
affected by rest? How is it influenced by
adrenin or by adrenal secretion? Answers to
these questions were sought in researches carried
on by C.&nbsp;M. <span class="nowrap">Gruber<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> in 1913.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Method of Determining the Threshold Stimulus</span></h3>

<p>The neuro-muscular arrangements used in these
researches were in many respects similar to those
already described in the account of experiments
by Nice and myself. To avoid the influence of an
anesthetic some of the animals were decerebrated
under ether and then used as in the experiments in
which urethane was the anesthetic. The nerve
(the <i lang="la">peroneus communis</i>) supplying the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i>
muscle was bared and severed; and near the
cut end shielded platinum electrodes were applied.
These electrodes were used in fatiguing the muscle.
Between these electrodes and the muscle other
platinum electrodes could be quickly applied to determine
the threshold stimulus and the tissue resistance.
These second electrodes were removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>
except when in use, and when replaced were set
always in the same position. Care was taken, before
replacing them, to wipe off moisture on the
nerve or on the platinum points.</p>

<p>For determining the threshold stimulus of the
muscle the skin and other overlying tissues were
cut away from the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> in two places
about 5 centimeters apart. Through these openings
platinum needle electrodes could be thrust
into the muscle whenever readings were to be
taken. Local polarization was avoided by reinserting
the needles into fresh points on the exposed
areas whenever new readings were to be taken.</p>

<p>The tendon of the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> was attached,
as in the previous experiments, by a strong thread
passing about pulleys to a lever which when lifted
stretched a spring. During the determination of
the threshold the spring was detached from the
lever, so that only the pull of the lever itself
(about 15 grams) was exerted on the muscle.</p>

<p>The method of measuring the stimulating value
of the electric current which was used in testing
the threshold was that devised by <span class="nowrap">E.&nbsp;G. Martin<a id="SNanchor_7" href="#Starnote_7" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> of
the Harvard Laboratory&mdash;a method by which the
strength of an induced electric shock is calculable
in definite units. If the tissue resistance enters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span>
into the calculation these are called β units. When
the threshold of the nerve-muscle was taken, the
apparatus for the determination was connected
with the nerve through the electrodes nearer the
muscle. They were separated from the fatiguing
electrodes by more than 3 centimeters, and arranged
so that the kathode was next the muscle.
When the threshold of the muscle was taken directly
the apparatus was connected with the muscle
through platinum needle electrodes thrust into it.
The position of the secondary coil of the inductorium,
in every case, was read by moving it away
from the primary coil until the very smallest possible
contraction of the muscle was obtained. Four
of these readings were made, one with tissue resistance,
the others with 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000
ohms additional resistance in the secondary circuit.
Only break shocks were employed&mdash;the
make shocks were short-circuited. Immediately
after the determination of the position of the secondary
coil, and before the electrodes were removed
or disconnected, three readings of the tissue
resistance were made. From these data four
values for β were calculated.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_7" href="#SNanchor_7" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  For a full account of Dr. Martin’s method of calculating
the strength of electric stimuli, see Martin: The Measurement
of Induction Shocks, New York, 1912.</p>
</div>

<p>The strength of the primary current for determining
the threshold of the nerve-muscle was usually
.01 ampere, but in a few cases .05 ampere was
used. For normal muscle it was .05 ampere and
for denervated muscle 1.0 ampere. The inductorium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>
which was used throughout, had a secondary
resistance of 1400 ohms. This was added to the
average tissue resistance in making corrections&mdash;corrections
were made also for core magnetization.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Lessening of Neuro-muscular Irritability by Fatigue</span></h3>

<p>The threshold for the <i lang="la">peroneus communis</i> nerve
in decerebrate animals varied from 0.319 to 2.96
units, with an average in sixteen experiments of
<span class="nowrap">1.179.<a id="SNanchor_8" href="#Starnote_8" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> This average is the same as that found by
E.&nbsp;L. <span class="nowrap">Porter<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> for the radial nerve in the spinal
cat. For animals under urethane anesthesia a
higher average was obtained. In these it varied
from .644 to 7.05, or an average in ten experiments
of 3.081.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_8" href="#SNanchor_8" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  For the detailed data of these and other quantitative experiments,
the reader should consult the tables in the original
papers.</p>
</div>

<p>The threshold for the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> muscle
varied in the decerebrate animals from 6.75 units
to 33.07, or an average in fifteen experiments of
18.8. Ten experiments were performed under urethane
anesthesia and the threshold varied from
12.53 to 54.9, with an average of 29.84 β units.
From these results it is evident that anesthesia
notably affects the threshold.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;L. Porter proved, by experiments carried on
in the Harvard Physiological Laboratory, that the
threshold of an undisturbed nerve-muscle remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>
constant for hours, and his observation was confirmed
by Gruber (see <a href=#Figure_19>Fig. 19</a>). If, therefore,
after fatigue, a change exists in the threshold, this
change is necessarily the result of alterations set
up by the fatigue process in the nerve-muscle or
muscle.</p>

<p>After fatigue the threshold of the nerve-muscle,
in sixteen decerebrate animals, increased from an
average of 1.179 to 3.34&mdash;an increase of 183 per
cent. In ten animals under urethane anesthesia
the threshold after fatigue increased from a normal
average of 3.08 to 9.408&mdash;an increase of 208
per cent.</p>

<p>An equal increase in the threshold stimulus was
obtained from the normal muscle directly. In decerebrate
animals the normal threshold of 18.8
units was increased by fatigue to 69.54, or an increase
of 274 per cent. With urethane anesthesia
the threshold increased from 29.849 to 66.238, or
an increase of 122 per cent.</p>

<p><a href=#Figure_18>Fig. 18</a>, plotted from the data of one of the many
experiments, shows the relative heights of the
threshold before and after fatigue. The correspondence
of the two readings of the threshold, one
from the nerve supplying the muscle and the other
from the muscle directly, served as a check on the
electrodes. The broken line in the figure represents
the threshold (in units) of the nerve-muscle,
and the continuous line that of the muscle. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
threshold values of the nerve-muscle have been
magnified ten times in order to bring the two records
close together. In this experiment the threshold
of the muscle after fatigue (<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, at 2) is 167 per
cent higher than the normal threshold (at 1), while
that of the nerve-muscle after fatigue is 30.5 per
cent higher than its normal.</p>

  <p>(3 and 4) The threshold after rest.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Evidently a direct relation exists between the
duration of work and the increase of threshold.
For instance, the threshold is higher after a muscle
is fatigued for two hours than it is at the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>
the first hour. The relation between the work
done and the threshold is not so clear. In some
animals the thresholds were higher after 120 grams
had been lifted 120 times a minute for 30 minutes
than they were in others in which 200 grams had
been lifted 240 times a minute for the same period.
The muscle in the latter instances did almost four
times as much work, yet the threshold was lower.
The difference may be due to the general condition
of the animal.</p>

<p>A few experiments were performed on animals
in which the nerve supplying the muscle was cut
seven to fourteen days previous to the experiment.
The muscle, therefore, had within it no living
nerve fibres. The average normal threshold for
the denervated muscle in 6 animals was 61.28 units.
As in the normal muscle, the percentage increase
due to fatigue was large.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Slow Restoration of Fatigued Muscle to Normal
Irritability by Rest</span></h3>

<p>That rest decreases the fatigue threshold of both
nerve-muscle and muscle can be seen in <a href=#Figure_18>Fig. 18</a>.
The time taken for total recovery, however, is dependent
upon the amount of work done, but this
change, like that of fatigue, varies widely with
different individuals. In some animals the threshold
returned to normal in 15 minutes; in others,
in which the same amount of work was done, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>
still above normal even after 2 hours of rest. This
may be due to the condition of the animals&mdash;in
some the metabolites are probably eliminated more
rapidly than in others. There were also variations
in the rate of restoration of the normal threshold
when tested on the nerve and when tested on the
muscle in the same animal. In <a href=#Figure_18>Fig. 18</a> (at 3) the
nerve-muscle returned to normal in 30 minutes,
whereas the muscle (at 4) after an hour’s rest had
not returned to normal by a few β units. This,
however, is not typical of all nerve-muscles and
muscles. The opposite condition&mdash;that in which
the muscle returned to normal before the nerve-muscle&mdash;occurred
in as many cases as did the condition
just cited. The failure of the two tissues to
alter uniformly in the same direction may be explained
as due to variations in the location of the
electrodes when thrust into the muscle at different
times (<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, whether near nerve filaments or not).
The results from observations made on the nerve
are more likely to be uniform and reliable than are
those from the muscle.</p>

<p>The time required for the restoration of the
threshold from fatigue to normal, in denervated
muscles, is approximately the same as that for the
normal muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Quick Restoration of Fatigued Muscle to Normal
Irritability by Adrenin</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing observations showed that fatigue
raises the normal threshold of a muscle, on the average,
between 100 and 200 per cent (it may be increased
more than 600 per cent); that this increase
is dependent on the time the muscle works, but
also varies with the animal; that rest, 15 minutes to
2 hours, restores the normal irritability; and that
this recovery of the threshold depends upon the
time given to rest, the duration of the work, and
also upon the condition of the animal. The problem
which was next attacked by Gruber was that of
learning whether the higher contractions of fatigued
muscle after splanchnic stimulation could
be attributed to any influence which adrenal secretion
might have in restoring the normal irritability.
To gain insight into the probabilities he tried first
the effects of injecting slowly into the jugular vein
physiological amounts of <span class="nowrap">adrenin.<a id="SNanchor_9" href="#Starnote_9" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_9" href="#SNanchor_9" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The form of adrenin used in these and in other injections
was fresh adrenalin made by Parke, Davis &amp; Co.</p>
</div>

<p>The normal threshold of the <i lang="la">peroneus communis</i>
nerve varied in the animals used in this series of
observations from 0.35 to 5.45 units, with an average
in nine experiments of 1.3, a figure close to the
1.179 found in the earlier series on the effect of
fatigue. For the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> muscle, in which
the nerve-endings were intact, the threshold varied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>
from 6.75 to 49.3 units, with an average in the nine
experiments of 22.2. This is slightly higher than
that cited for this same muscle in the earlier series.
By fatigue the threshold of the nerve-muscle was
increased from an average of 1.3 to an average of
3.3 units, an increase of 154 per cent. The muscle
increased from an average of 22.2 to an average of
59.6, an increase of 169 per cent. After an injection
of 0.1 to 0.5 cubic centimeters of adrenin
(1:100,000) the fatigue threshold was decreased
<em>within five minutes</em> in the nerve-muscle from an
average of 3.3 to 1.8, a recovery of 75 per cent, and
in the muscle from an average of 59.6 to 42.4, a recovery
of 46 per cent. To prove that this effect of
adrenin is a <em>counteraction of the effects of fatigue</em>,
Gruber determined the threshold for muscle and
nerve-muscle in non-fatigued animals before and
after adrenin injection. He found that in these
cases no lowering of threshold occurred, a result in
marked contrast with the pronounced and prompt
lowering induced by this agent in muscles when
fatigued.</p>

<p><a href=#Figure_19>Figs. 19</a> and <a href=#Figure_20>20</a>, plotted from the data of two of
the experiments, show the relative heights of the
threshold before and after an injection of adrenin.
The close correspondence of the two readings of
the threshold, one from the nerve supplying the
muscle, the other from the muscle directly, served
to show that there was no fault in the electrodes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>
The continuous line in the Figures represents the
threshold (in units) of the muscle, the broken line
that of the nerve-muscle. The threshold of the
nerve-muscle is magnified 100 times in <a href=#Figure_19>Fig. 19</a> and
10 times in <a href=#Figure_20>Fig. 20</a>. In <a href=#Figure_19>Fig. 19</a> (at 2 and 4) the
threshold was taken after an intravenous injection
of 0.1 and 0.2 cubic centimeter of adrenin respectively.</p>

<p>These examples show that adrenin does not affect
the threshold of the normal non-fatigued muscle
when tested either on the muscle directly or on
the nerve-muscle. In Fig. 19 (at 3) the observation
taken after two hours of rest illustrates the
constancy of the threshold under these circumstances.</p>

<p>In <a href=#Figure_19>Fig. 19</a> the normal threshold was increased by
fatigue (at 5)&mdash;the muscle had been pulling 120
times a minute for one hour on a spring having
an initial tension of 120 grams&mdash;from 30.0
to 51.6 units, an increase of 72 per cent; and in
the nerve-muscle from 0.62 to 0.89 units, an
increase of 46 per cent. The threshold (at 6)
was taken <em>five minutes</em> after injecting 0.1 cubic
centimeter of adrenin (1:100,000). The threshold
of the muscle was lowered from 51.6 to
38.0 units, a recovery of 62 per cent; that of the
nerve-muscle from 0.89 to 0.79 units, a recovery of
37 per cent. After another injection of 0.5 cubic
centimeter of adrenin the thresholds (at 7) were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span>
taken; that of the nerve-muscle dropped to normal&mdash;0.59
units&mdash;a recovery of 100 per cent, and that
of the muscle remained unaltered&mdash;26 per cent
above its normal threshold.</p>

<p>In <a href=#Figure_20>Fig. 20</a> the threshold (at 5) was taken five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
minutes after an injection of 0.1 cubic centimeter
of adrenin. The drop here was as large as that
shown in <a href=#Figure_19>Fig. 19</a>. The threshold taken from the
muscle directly was lowered from 30.6 to 18 units,
a recovery of 61 per cent; the nerve-muscle from
1.08 to 0.87 units, a recovery of 51 per cent. That
this sudden decrease cannot be due to rest is shown
in the same Figure (at 3 and 4). These readings
were made after 60 and 90 minutes’ rest respectively.
The sharp decline in the record (at 5) indicates
distinctly the remarkable restorative influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>
of adrenin in promptly lowering the high
fatigue threshold of neuro-muscular irritability.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Evidence that the Restorative Action of Adrenin is
Specific</span></h3>

<p>As stated in describing the effects of arterial
blood pressure, an increase of pressure is capable
of causing a decided lowering of the neuro-muscular
threshold after fatigue. Is it not possible that
adrenin produces its beneficial effects by bettering
the circulation?</p>

<p>Nice and I had argued that the higher contractions
of fatigued muscle, that follow stimulation or
injection of adrenin, could not be wholly due to
improved blood flow through the muscle, for when
by traction on the aorta or compression of the
thorax arterial pressure in the hind legs was prevented
from rising, splanchnic stimulation still
caused a distinct improvement, the initial appearance
of which coincided with the point in the blood-pressure
curve at which evidence of adrenal secretion
appeared. And, furthermore, the improvement
was seen also when adrenin was given intravenously
in such weak solution (1:100,000) as to
produce a <em>fall</em> instead of a rise of arterial pressure.
Lyman and I had shown that this fall of pressure
was due to a dilator effect of adrenin. Since the
blood vessels of the fatigued muscle were dilated by
severance of their nerves when the nerve trunk was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span>
cut, and, besides, as previously stated (see <a href=#Page_86>p. 86</a>),
were being stimulated through their nerves at a
rate favorable to relaxation, it seemed hardly probable
that adrenin could produce its beneficial effect
by further dilation of the vessels and by consequent
flushing of the muscle with an extra supply of
<span class="nowrap">blood.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> The lowering of blood pressure had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>
been proved to have no other effect than to impair
the action of the muscle (see <a href=#Page_103>p. 103</a>). Although the
chances were thus against an interpretation of the
beneficial influence of adrenin through action on
the circulation, it was thought desirable to test
the possibility by comparing its effect with that
of another vasodilator&mdash;amyl nitrite.</p>

<p><a href=#Figure_21>Figs. 21</a> and <a href=#Figure_22>22</a> are curves obtained from the left
<i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> muscle. The rate of stimulation
was 240 times a minute.</p>

<p>The muscle in <a href=#Figure_21>Fig. 21</a> contracted against a spring
having an initial tension of 120 grams, and that in
<a href=#Figure_22>Fig. 22</a> against an initial tension of 100 grams. In
<a href=#Figure_21>Fig. 21</a>, at the point indicated on the base line, 0.4
cubic centimeter of adrenin (1:100,000) was injected
into the left external jugular vein. There
resulted a fall of 25 millimeters of mercury in the
arterial pressure and a concurrent betterment of 15
per cent in the height of contraction, requiring
two minutes and fifteen seconds of fatigue (about
540 contractions) before it returned to the former
level. In <a href=#Figure_22>Fig. 22</a>, at the point indicated by the
arrow, a solution of amyl nitrite was injected into
the right external jugular vein. There resulted a
fall of 70 millimeters of mercury in arterial pressure
and a betterment of 4.1 per cent in the height
of muscular contraction, requiring fifteen seconds
of fatigue (about 60 contractions) to decrease the
height of contraction to its former level. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>
neither case did the blood pressure fall below the
critical region (see <span class="nowrap"><a href=#Page_104>p. 104</a>).<a id="SNanchor_10" href="#Starnote_10" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_10" href="#SNanchor_10" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  In some cases after injection of amyl nitrite the normal
blood pressure, which was high, dropped sharply to a point
below the critical region. There resulted a primary increase
in muscular contraction due to the betterment in circulation
caused by the dilation of the vessels before the critical region
was reached. During the time that the pressure was below
the critical region the muscle contraction fell. As the blood
pressure again rose to normal the muscle contraction increased
coincidently.</p>

<p>Although the fall in arterial pressure caused by
dilation of the vessels due to amyl nitrite was almost
three times as great as that produced by the
adrenin, yet the resultant betterment was only
about one-fourth the percentage height and lasted
but one-ninth the time. In all cases in which these
solutions caused an <em>equal</em> fall in arterial pressure,
adrenin caused higher contractions, whereas amyl
nitrite caused <em>no appreciable change</em>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Point of Action of Adrenin in Muscle</span></h3>

<p>From the evidence presented in the foregoing
pages it is clear that adrenin somehow is able to
bring about a rapid recovery of normal irritability
of muscle after the irritability has been much lessened
by fatigue, and that the higher contractions
of a fatigued muscle after an injection of adrenin
are due, certainly in part, to some specific action
of this substance and not wholly to its influence on
the circulation. Some of the earlier investigators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span>
of adrenal function, notably <span class="nowrap">Albanese,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> and also
Abelous and <span class="nowrap">Langlois,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> inferred from experiments
on the removal of the glands that the rôle
they played in the bodily economy was that of neutralizing,
destroying or transforming toxic substances
produced in the organism as a result of
muscular or nervous work. It seemed possible that
the metabolites might have a checking or blocking
influence at the junction of the nerve fibres with the
muscle fibres, and might thus, like curare, lessen the
efficiency of the nerve impulses. Radwánska’s <span class="nowrap">observation<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
that the beneficial action of adrenin is
far greater when the muscle is stimulated through
its nerve than when stimulated directly, and Panella’s
<span class="nowrap">discovery<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> that adrenin antagonizes the effect
of curare, were favorable to the view that
adrenin improves the contraction of fatigued muscle
by lessening or removing a block established by
accumulated metabolites.</p>

<p>The high threshold of fatigued denervated muscle,
however, Gruber found was quite as promptly
lowered by adrenin as was that of normal muscles
stimulated through their nerves. <a href=#Figure_23>Fig. 23</a> shows
that the height of contraction, also, of the fatigued
muscle is increased when adrenin is administered.
In this experiment the left <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> muscle
was stimulated directly by thrusting platinum
needle electrodes into it. The <i lang="la">peroneus communis</i>
nerve supplying the muscle had been cut and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>
centimeters of it removed nine days previous to
the experiment. The rate of stimulation was 120
times per minute and the initial tension of the
spring about 120 grams. At the point indicated
by the arrow an injection of 0.1 cubic centimeter
of adrenin (1:100,000) was made into a jugular
vein. A fall in arterial pressure from 110 to 86
millimeters of mercury and a simultaneous betterment
of 20 per cent in the height of contraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>
were obtained. It required four minutes of fatigue
(about 480 contractions) to restore the muscle
curve to its former level. Results similar to this
were obtained from animals in which the nerve had
been cut 7, 9, 12, 14, and 21 days. In all instances
the nerve was inexcitable to strong faradic stimulation.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_23">
  <img class="w70" src="images/fig23.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 23.</span>&mdash;Top record, blood pressure with

record (zero blood pressure), time in half minutes.
At the point indicated by an arrow 0.1 cubic
centimeter of adrenin (1:100,000) was injected
intravenously.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Radwánska’s experiments, mentioned above,
the muscle was stimulated directly when the nerve
endings were intact. It seems reasonable to suppose,
therefore, that in all cases he was stimulating
nerve tissue. Since a muscle is more irritable
when stimulated through its nerve than when
stimulated directly (nerve and muscle), a slight
change in the irritability of the muscle by adrenin
would naturally result in a greater contraction
when the nerve was stimulated. Panella’s results
also are not inconsistent with the interpretation
that the effect of adrenin is on the muscle substance
rather than on the nerve endings. A method which
has long been used to separate muscle from nerve
is that of blocking the nervous impulses by the
drug curare. Gruber found that when curare is injected
the threshold of the normal muscle is increased
as was to be expected from the removal of
the highly efficient nervous stimulations. And also,
as was to be expected on that basis, curare did not
increase the threshold in a muscle in which the
nerve endings had degenerated. Adrenin antagonizes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>
curare with great promptness, decreasing the
heightened threshold of a curarized muscle, in five
minutes or less, in some cases to normal. From
this observation it might be supposed that curare
and fatigue had the same effect, and that adrenin
had the single action of opposing that effect. But
fatigue raises the threshold of a <em>curarized</em> muscle,
and adrenin then antagonizes this fatigue. <span class="nowrap">Langley<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
has argued that curare acts upon a hypothetical
“receptive substance” in muscle. If so,
probably curare acts upon a substance, or at a
point, different from that upon which fatigue acts;
for, as the foregoing evidence shows, fatigue increases
the threshold of a muscle whether deprived
of its nerve supply by nerve section and degeneration
or by curare, whereas curare affects only the
threshold of a muscle in which the nerve endings
are <span class="nowrap">normal.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> And since adrenin can oppose the
effects of both curare and fatigue, it may be said
to have two actions, or to act on two different
substances or at two different points in the muscle.</p>

<p>The evidence adduced in the last chapter indicated
that the greater “head” of arterial pressure
produced by the more rapid heart beat and the
stronger contraction of many arterioles in times of
great excitement would be highly serviceable to the
organism in any extensive muscular activity which
the excitement might involve. By assuring an
abundant flow of blood through the enlarged vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>
of the working muscle, the waste products
resulting from the wear and tear in contraction
would be promptly swept away and thus would
be prevented from impairing the muscular efficiency.
The adrenin discharge at such times would,
as was pointed out, probably reënforce the effects
of sympathetic impulses. The evidence presented
in this chapter shows that adrenin has also another
action, a very remarkable action, that of restoring
to a muscle its original ability to respond to
stimulation, after that has been largely lost by
continued activity through a long period. What
rest will do only after an hour or more, adrenin
will do in five minutes or less. The bearing of this
striking phenomenon on the functions of the organism
in times of great need for muscular activity
will be considered in a later discussion.</p>

<p class="center">THE HASTENING OF COAGULATION OF BLOOD
BY ADRENIN</p>


<p class="sp2">The primary value of blood to the body must
have been one of the earliest observations of reasoning
beings. When we consider the variety of
fundamental services which this circulating fluid
performs&mdash;the conveyance of food and oxygen to
all the tissues, the removal of waste, the delivery of
the internal secretions, the protection of the body
against toxins and bacterial invasion, and the distribution
of heat from active to inactive regions&mdash;the
view of the ancient Hebrews that the “life of
the flesh is in the blood” is well justified. It is
naturally of the utmost importance that this precious
fluid shall be safeguarded against loss. And
its property of turning to a jelly soon after escaping
from its natural channels assures a closure of
the opening through which the escape occurred, and
thus protection of the body from further bleeding.
The slight evidence that adrenin hastens the clotting
process has already been hinted at. When we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
found that adrenin is set free in pain and intense
emotion, it seemed possible that there might exist
in the body an arrangement for making doubly
sure the assurance against loss of blood, a process
that might nicely play its rôle precisely when
the greatest need for it would be likely to arise.</p>

<p>It was in 1903, while tracing in dogs the rise and
fall of sugar in the blood after administering
adrenin, that Vosburgh and <span class="nowrap">Richards<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> first noted
that simultaneously with the increase of blood
sugar there occurred more rapid coagulation. In
some cases the diminution was as much as four-fifths
the coagulation time of the control. Since
this result was obtained by painting “adrenalin”
on the pancreas, as well as by injecting it into the
abdominal cavity, they concluded that “the phenomenon
appears to be due to the application of
adrenalin to the pancreas.” Six years later, during
a study of the effect of adrenalin on internal
hemorrhage, <span class="nowrap">Wiggers<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> examined incidentally the
evidence presented by Vosburgh and Richards,
and after many tests on five dogs found “never
the slightest indication that adrenalin, either when
injected or added to the blood, appreciably hastened
the coagulation process.” In 1911 von den
Velden[3] reported that adrenin (about 0.007 milligram
per kilo of body weight) decreased the
coagulation time in man about one-half&mdash;an effect
appearing 11 minutes after administration by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>
mouth, and 85 minutes after subcutaneous injection.
He affirmed also, but without describing the
conditions or giving figures, that adrenin decreases
coagulation time <i lang="la" title="in glassware">in vitro</i>. He did not attribute
the coagulative effect of adrenin in patients
to this direct action on the blood, however, but to
vasoconstriction disturbing the normal circulation
and thereby the normal equilibrium between blood
and tissue. In consequence, the tissue juices with
their coagulative properties enter the blood, so he
assumed. In support of this theory he offered his
observation that coagulation time is decreased
after the nasal mucosa has been rendered anemic by
adrenin pledgets. Von den Velden’s <span class="nowrap">claim<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> for
adrenin given by mouth was subjected to a single
test on man by Dale and <span class="nowrap">Laidlaw,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> but their result
was completely negative.</p>

<p>The importance of Vosburgh and Richards’ observation,
the thoroughly discordant testimony of
later investigators, as well as the meager and incidental
nature of all the evidence that has been adduced
either for or against the acceleration of clotting
by adrenin, made desirable a further study of
this matter. Especially was this further study desirable
because of the discharge of adrenin into
the blood in pain and emotional excitement. Accordingly,
in 1914, H. Gray and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> undertook an
investigation of the question. In doing so we employed
cats as subjects. Usually they were quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>
decerebrated under ether, and then continuance of
the drug became unnecessary. Body temperature
was maintained by means of an electric heating
pad. Respiration proceeded normally except in a
few instances (in which, presumably, there was
hemorrhage into the medulla), when artificial respiration
had to be given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Graphic Method of Measuring the Coagulation
Time</span></h3>

<p>In order to avoid, so far as possible, the personal
element in determining when the blood was clotted,
the blood was made to record its own clotting. The
instrument by means of which this was done was
the graphic coagulometer devised by W.&nbsp;L. Mendenhall
and <span class="nowrap">myself,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> and illustrated diagrammatically
in <a href=#Figure_24>Fig. 24</a>. It consists essentially of a
light aluminum lever with the long arm nearly
counterpoised by a weight <i>W</i>. The long arm is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span>
prevented from falling by a support <i>S</i>, and is prevented
from rising by a horizontal right-angled
rod reaching over the lever at <i>R<sup>1</sup></i> and fixed into the
block <i>B</i> which turns on the axis <i>A</i>. Into the same
block is fixed the vertical rod <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>. When this rod
is moved from the post <i>P<sup>1</sup></i>, against which it is held
by the weight of the horizontal rod <i>R<sup>1</sup></i>, towards the
other post <i>P<sup>2</sup></i>, the check on the long arm of the
lever is lifted, and if the short arm is heavier, the
long arm will then rise.</p>

<span class="smcap">Figure 24.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the graphic coagulometer. The cannula
at the right rests in a water bath not shown in this diagram.
For further description see text.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cannula <i>C</i>, into which the blood is received,
is two centimeters in total length and slightly more
than two millimeters in internal diameter. It is
attached by a short piece of rubber tubing to the
tapered glass tube <i>T</i>, five centimeters long and five
millimeters in internal diameter. The upper end
of this tube is surrounded by another piece of rubber
which supports the tube when it is slid into the
U-shaped support <i>U</i>, fixed directly below the end
of the short arm of the lever.</p>

<p>By drawing the cannulas from a single piece of
glass tubing and by making the distance from
shoulder to upper end about twelve millimeters,
receptacles of fairly uniform capacity are assured.
All the dimensions, the reach of the rubber connection
over the top of the cannula (2&ndash;3 millimeters),
the distance of the upper rubber ring
from the lower end of the glass chamber (4 centimeters),
etc., were as nearly standard as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span></p>

<p>A copper wire <i>D</i>, eight centimeters long and 0.6
millimeters in diameter, bent above into a hook
and below into a small ring slightly less than two
millimeters in diameter, is hung in a depression at
the end of the short arm of the lever. The small
ring then rests in the upper part of the cannula
(see <a href=#Figure_24>Fig. 24</a>). The weight of the copper wire
makes the short arm of the lever heavier than the
long arm by 30 milligrams, when the delicate writing
point is moving over a lightly smoked drum.
Half a dozen of these standard wires are needed.</p>

<p>For accurate determination of the coagulation
time <span class="nowrap">Addis<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> has defined the following conditions
as essential:</p>

<p>1. The blood must always be obtained under the
same conditions.</p>

<p>2. Estimates must all be made at the same temperature.</p>

<p>3. The blood must always come in contact with
the same amount and kind of foreign material.</p>

<p>4. The end point must be clear and definite and
must always indicate the same degree of coagulation.</p>

<p>The precautions taken to fulfill these conditions
were as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Drawing the blood.</i>&mdash;The blood was taken
from the femoral artery. The artery (usually the
right) was laid bare in the groin and freed from
surrounding tissue. A narrow artery clip, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>
each limb enclosed in soft rubber tubing (to prevent
injury of the tissues), and with its spring exerting
gentle pressure, was placed on the artery
immediately below the deep femoral branch, thus
allowing no blood to stagnate above the clip. Between
the clip and a ligature applied about 1.5
centimeters below, an opening was made. The
blood was carefully milked out of the vessels between
a blunt dissector moved beneath, and a small
forceps, twisted into a pinch of absorbent cotton,
moved above.</p>

<p>The cannula, cleaned in water, alcohol, and ether,
was set in the rubber connection of the glass tube;
the point of the cannula was then lubricated with
vaseline and slipped into the artery. The pressure
of the clip on the artery was next very slightly
released and blood was allowed to flow into the
cannula up to the lower border of the rubber connection.
Only a good-sized drop of blood was
needed. Sometimes the blood ran one or two millimeters
above or below, but without appreciably
changing the result. Since the clip was situated on
the femoral immediately below a branch in which
the circulation persisted, <em>the blood received in the
cannula was always fresh from the moving stream</em>.
As soon as the clip gripped the artery again, the
cannula was slipped out. A helper then promptly
milked the vessel in the manner described above,
and covered it with a pad of absorbent cotton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>
smeared with vaseline to prevent drying. Thereby
blood was not permitted to stagnate; and when
a new sample was to be taken, the vessel was clean
and ready for use.</p>

<p>The tip of the cannula was at once plugged by
plunging it into a flat mound of plasticine about
three millimeters high. It was drawn off sidewise
lest the plasticine plug be pulled out again. One
of the copper wires <i>D</i> was now slid into the tube
and cannula, the tube slipped into the U-support,
and the wire lifted and hung on the lever. This
procedure, from the moment blood began to flow
until the wire was hung, consumed usually about
twenty seconds.</p>

<p>2. <i>Uniform temperature.</i>&mdash;Under the U-support
was placed a large water bath, in which the cannula
and the tapering part of the tube were submerged.
A thermometer was fixed to the U-support
so that the bulb came near the cannula in the
bath. The water was kept within a degree of 25°&nbsp;C. This temperature was chosen for several reasons:
(a) The cannula has room temperature and
rapidly cools the small volume of blood that enters
it. To heat blood and cannula to body temperature
would take time. A bath near room temperature,
therefore, seems preferable to one near body
temperature. (b) The test of clotting was conveniently
made at intervals of a half-minute, and if the
clotting process were hastened by higher temperatures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
this interval would become relatively less
exact. (c) A temperature of 25°&nbsp;C. rather than
lower was selected because, as Dale and <span class="nowrap">Laidlaw<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
have shown, the coagulation time is much slower
for a given change in temperature below 25°
than for the same change above. And with slowing
of the process the end point, when the determination
depends on supporting a weight, is less likely
to be sharp. (d) The researches undertaken with
use of this coagulometer were concerned with factors
hastening the process. For that reason and
for reason (b), a long rather than a short coagulation
time for normal conditions was desirable.</p>

<p>3. <i>Uniformity in the amount and kind of contact
with foreign surface.</i>&mdash;The capacity of the cannulas
was fairly uniform, as stated above; the
amount received in them was fairly constant; and
the wire hanging in the blood presented approximately
the same surface in different observations.</p>

<p>A further condition for insuring consistent treatment
of the blood in different cases was that of
making the tests for coagulation always at the
same intervals. Below the writing point of the
lever was set an electromagnetic signal <i>E</i>, which
recorded half-minutes. At the moment a record
was made by the signal (see first signal mark, <a href=#Figure_25>Fig.
25</a>) the clip on the artery was opened, the blood
taken, and the process thus begun. In about 20
seconds the cannula was suspended in the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span>
bath and the wire was hanging on the lever. At the
next record by the signal and at every subsequent
record the vertical rod <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> was pushed with the
index finger from post <i>P<sup>1</sup></i> to post <i>P<sup>2</sup></i> and allowed to
move back. This motion was uniform and lasted
about one second. The check <i>R<sup>1</sup></i> on the long arm of
the lever was thus raised, and as the wire sank in
the blood the writing point rose, recording that
coagulation had not taken place (see <a href=#Figure_25>Fig. 25</a>).</p>

condition. The lower line records intervals of 30 seconds. The marks below the time record indicate the moments
when the blood samples were drawn.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>4. <i>Definite end point.</i>&mdash;As soon as the blood clotted,
the weight of 30 milligrams was supported, and
the failure of the lever to rise to the former height
in the regular time allowed, recorded that the
change had occurred.</p>

<p>Very rarely the swing of the lever would be
checked for a moment and would then begin to
move rapidly, indicating that a strand of fibrin had
formed but not sufficiently strong to support the
weight, and that when the strand broke, the weight
quickly sank in the blood. If this occurred, the
next record almost always was the short line, which
signified that the weight was well supported.</p>

<p>A very slight strand of fibrin was able to prevent
the weight from dropping, though at different
times the amount of support differed, as shown by
the varying length of the final lines (compare first
and last series, <a href=#Figure_25>Fig. 25</a>). These variations are
probably a rough indication of the degree of coagulation.
In our experiments, however, the length of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>
the final line was disregarded, and merely the fact
that the lever failed to swing through its usual
distance was taken as evidence of a clot, and the
consequent short record was taken as the end point.</p>

<p>As soon as this end point was registered, the
tube, wire and cannula were lifted out of the bath;
the cannula was then separated from the tube and
pulled away from the wire. The clot was thus disclosed,
confirming the graphic record.</p>

<p>The method, at least when used at half-minute
intervals, did not reveal in all instances the same
degree of clotting. Usually, when the process was
very rapid, the revealed clot was a thick jelly;
whereas, when the process was slow, a strand of
fibrin or at most a small amount of jelly was found.
This difference in the <em>degree</em> of coagulation introduced,
of course, an element of inexactness. In our
experiments, however, this inexactness was unfavorable
to the result we were seeking for, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, the
acceleration of the process&mdash;because the jelly is a
later stage than the fibrin strand; and since we
nevertheless obtained good evidence of acceleration,
we did not in these experiments attempt to
determine more accurately differences in the stage
of the clotting process.</p>

<p>5. <i>Cleaning of apparatus.</i>&mdash;After the wire was
removed from the tube, the clot attached to its
ring-tip was carefully brushed away under cool
running water. Under the running water, also, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>
trimmed feather was introduced into the cannula
and the tube to push out the plasticine and to wash
out the blood. Wire, cannula and tube were then
dropped into a beaker receiving running hot water
(about 80°&nbsp;C.) and there allowed to remain for
about five minutes. On removal from this the
parts were shaken free from water, passed through
95 per cent alcohol and again shaken free, passed
through ether and let dry.</p>

<p>By having a half-dozen cannulas and wires of
standard size, it was possible to save trouble by
cleaning a number at one time.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the first few samples of blood
taken from an animal showed rapid or somewhat
irregular rates of clotting. Some causes for these
initial variations will be presented in following
pages. The fairly uniform rate of clotting in any
individual after the initial stage, varied in twenty-one
different animals from an average of 3 to an
average of 10.6 minutes, with a combined average
of 5.9 minutes. The conditions for these variations
among the individuals have not been wholly determined.</p>

<p class="noindent">As will be shown later, the dose in this instance
was ten times the minimal effective <em>intravenous</em>
dose. On the basis of these figures, less than a
milligram of adrenin given subcutaneously would
be necessary to shorten clotting to a marked degree
in a man of average weight (70 kilograms).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span></p>

<p>Not many observations were made by us on the
effects of adrenin administered subcutaneously.
The amount reaching the vascular system and the
rate of its entrance into the blood could be so much
more accurately controlled by intravenous than by
subcutaneous introduction that most of our attention
was devoted to the latter method.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Effects of Intravenous Injections</span></h3>

<p>In this procedure a glass cannula was fastened
in one of the external jugular veins and filled with
the same solution as that to be injected. A short
rubber tube was attached and tightly clamped close
to the glass. Later, for the injection, the syringe
needle was inserted through the rubber and into
the fluid in the cannula, the clip on the vein was
removed, and the injection made.</p>

<p>The solutions employed intravenously were
adrenin 1:10,000, 1:50,000, and 1:100,000, in distilled
water.</p>

<p>The smallest amount which produced any change
in clotting time was 0.1 cubic centimeter of a dilution
of 1:100,000 in a cat weighing two kilos, a dose
of 0.0005 milligram per kilo. Four tests previous
to the injection averaged 5 minutes, and none was
shorter than 4 minutes. Immediately after the injection
the time was 2 minutes, but at the next
test the effect had disappeared. Doubling the
dose in the same cat&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, giving 0.2 cubic centimeter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span>
(0.001 milligram per kilo)&mdash;shortened the

<p>From 10.47, immediately after the second injection,
till 11.20 the average time for clotting was 2.5
minutes, whereas both before and after this period
the time was 4 minutes or longer. At 11.00 o’clock
and 11.05, when the end point was reached in 1.5
minutes (a reduction of 63 per cent), a thick jelly
was found on examining the cannula. The changes
in clotting time in this case are represented graphically

has reported the interesting observation that
repeated massive doses of adrenin given to dogs
may so greatly retard coagulation that the animals
may be said to be hemophilic. These two instances
show that on coagulation large doses have the
contrary effect to small, just as <span class="nowrap">Hoskins<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> showed
was true for intestinal and Lyman and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> showed
was true for arterial smooth muscle.</p>

<p>In a few experiments the brain and the cord to
midthorax were destroyed through the orbit. Artificial
respiration then maintained the animal in uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>
condition. Under these circumstances, adrenin
intravenously had more lasting effects than
when given to the usual decerebrate animals with
intact cord. <a href=#Figure_28>Fig. 28</a> illustrates such a case. For
thirty minutes before injection the clotting time
averaged 5.4 minutes. Then, about ten minutes
after one cubic centimeter of adrenin, 1:50,000, had
been slowly injected, clotting began to quicken;
during the next twenty minutes the average was 3.4
minutes, and during the following forty-five minutes
the average was 1.9 minutes&mdash;only 35 per cent
as long as it had been before the injection.</p>

dash lines represent averages.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In another case in which the brain and upper
cord were similarly destroyed, the clotting time,
which for a half-hour had averaged 3.9 minutes,
was reduced by one cubic centimeter of adrenin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
1:100,000, to an average for the next hour and forty
minutes of 2.3 minutes, with 1.5 and 3 minutes as
extremes. During the first forty minutes of this
period of one hour and forty minutes of rapid clotting
all of eight tests except two showed a coagulation
time of 2 minutes or less. The explanation of
this persistent rapid clotting in animals with spinal
cord pithed is not yet clear.</p>

<p>As indicated in Figs. 26, 27 and 28, the records
of coagulation show oscillations. Some of these
ups and downs are, of course, within the limits of
error of the method, but in our experience they
have occurred so characteristically after injection
of adrenin, and so often have appeared in a rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>
rhythm, that they have given the impression of being
real accompaniments of faster clotting. It
may be that two factors are operating, one tending
to hasten, the other to retard the process, and that
the equilibrium disturbed by adrenin is recovered
only after interaction to and fro between the two
factors.</p>

<p>The oscillations in coagulation time after the injections
suggest that clotting might vary with
changes in blood pressure, for that also commonly
oscillates after a dose of adrenin (see, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="for example">e.&#8201;g.</abbr></span>, <a href=#Figure_23>Fig.
23</a>). Simultaneous recording of blood pressure
and determining of coagulation time have revealed
that each may vary without corresponding variation
in the other. Within ordinary limits, therefore,
changes of blood pressure do not change the
rate of clotting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Hastening of Coagulation by Adrenin Not a Direct
Effect on the Blood</span></h3>

<p>As previously stated, von den Velden has contended
that shortening of coagulation time by adrenin
is due to exudation of tissue juices resulting
from vasoconstriction. The amount of adrenin
which produces markedly faster clotting in the
cat, is approximately 0.001 milligram per kilo. As
Lyman and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> showed, however, this amount
when injected slowly, as in the present experiments,
results in brief vasodilation rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>
vasoconstriction. Von den Velden’s explanation
can therefore not be applied to these experiments.</p>

<p>He has claimed, furthermore, that adrenin added
to blood <i lang="la" title="in glassware">in vitro</i> makes it clot more rapidly, but,
as already noted, he gives no account of the conditions
of his experiments and no figures. It is impossible,
therefore, to criticise them. His claim,
however, is contrary to Wiggers’<span class="nowrap">s<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> earlier observations
that blood with added adrenin coagulated
no more quickly than blood with an equal
amount of added physiological salt solution. Also
contrary to this claim are the following two experiments:
(1) Ligatures were tied around the aorta
and inferior vena cava immediately above the diaphragm,
and thus the circulation was confined almost
completely to the anterior part of the animal.
Indeed, since the posterior part ceases to function
in the absence of blood supply, the preparation
may be called an “anterior animal.” When such a
preparation was made and 0.5 cubic centimeter of
adrenin, 1:100,000 (half the usual dose, because,
roughly, half an animal), was injected slowly into
one of the jugulars, coagulation was not shortened.
Whereas for a half-hour before the injection the
clotting time averaged 4.6 minutes, for an hour
thereafter the average was 5.3 minutes&mdash;a prolongation
which may have been due, not to any influence
of adrenin, but to failure of the blood to
circulate through the intestines and <span class="nowrap">liver.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> In another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>
experiment after the gastro-intestinal canal
and liver had been removed from the animal, the
average time for coagulation during twenty-five
minutes before injecting adrenin (0.23 cubic centimeter,
1:100,000, in an animal weighing originally
2.3 kilos) was 5.5 minutes, and during forty minutes
after the injection it was 6.8 minutes, with no
case shorter than 6 minutes. In the absence of circulation
through the abdominal viscera, therefore,
adrenin fails to shorten the clotting time. (2) The
cannulas were filled with adrenin, 1:1,000, and
emptied just before being introduced into the
artery. The small amount of adrenin left on the
walls was thus automatically mixed with the drawn
blood. Alternate observations with these cannulas
wet by adrenin and with the usual dry cannulas
showed no noteworthy distinction.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments have made it
impossible for us to concede either of von den
Velden’s claims, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, that clotting occurs faster because
adrenin is added to the blood, or because
adrenin by producing vasoconstriction causes tissues
to exude coagulant juices.</p>

<p>Vosburgh and Richards found that coagulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>
became more rapid as the blood sugar increased.
Conceivably faster clotting might result from this
higher percentage of blood sugar. Against this
assumption, however, is the fact that clotting is
greatly accelerated by 0.001 milligram adrenin per
kilo of body weight, much less than the dose
necessary to increase the sugar content of the
<span class="nowrap">blood.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> And furthermore, when dextrose (3 cubic
centimeters of a 10 per cent solution) is added to
the blood of an anterior animal, making the blood
sugar roughly 0.3 per cent, the coagulation time
is not markedly reduced. Adrenin appears to act,
therefore, in some other way than by increasing
blood sugar.</p>

<p>Since adrenin makes the blood clot much faster
than normally in the intact animal, and fails to
have this effect when the circulation is confined to
the anterior animal, the inference is justified that
in the small doses here employed adrenin produces
its remarkable effects, not directly on the blood itself,
not through change in the extensive neuro-muscular,
bony, or surface tissues of the body, but
through some organ in the abdomen.</p>

<p>That exclusion of the liver from the bodily economy,
by ligature of its vessels or by phosphorus
poisoning, will result in great lengthening of the
coagulation time has been clearly shown. The
liver, therefore, seems to furnish continuously to
the blood a factor in the clotting process which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>
being continuously destroyed in the body. It is not
unlikely that adrenin makes the blood clot more
rapidly by stimulating the liver to discharge this
factor in greater abundance. But proof for this
suggestion has not yet been established.</p>

<p class="center">THE HASTENING OF THE COAGULATION OF
BLOOD IN PAIN AND GREAT EMOTION</p>


<p class="sp2">In the foregoing chapter evidence was presented
that the intravenous injection of minute amounts
of adrenin hastens the clotting of blood. The
amounts used did not vary much above or below
the amounts discharged by the adrenal glands after
brief stimulation of the splanchnic nerves, as
found by H. Osgood in the Harvard Laboratory,
and may therefore be regarded as physiological.
Since injected adrenin is capable of shortening the
coagulation time, may not the increased secretion
of the adrenals likewise have that effect? The answer
to this question was the object of an investigation
by W.&nbsp;L. Mendenhall and <span class="nowrap">myself.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood was taken and its coagulation was recorded
graphically in the manner already described.
In some instances the cats were etherized,
in others they were anesthetized with urethane, or
were decerebrated. The splanchnic nerves always
were stimulated after being cut away from connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span>
with the spinal cord. Sometimes the nerves
were isolated unilaterally in the abdomen; sometimes,
in order to avoid manipulation of the abdominal
viscera, they were isolated in the thorax and
stimulated singly or together. A tetanizing current
was used, barely perceptible on the tongue
and too weak to cause by spreading any contraction
of skeletal muscles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coagulation Hastened by Splanchnic Stimulation</span></h3>

<p>That splanchnic stimulation accelerates the clotting
of blood, and that the effects vary in different
animals, are facts illustrated in the following
cases:</p>

<p>Oct. 25.&mdash;A cat was etherized and maintained in
uniform ether anesthesia. After forty minutes of
preliminary observation the left splanchnic nerves
were stimulated in the abdomen. Following are

<p>In this instance at least ten minutes elapsed between
the end of stimulation and the beginning of
faster clotting. The period of faster clotting, however,
lasted for about a half-hour, during which the
coagulation time averaged 2.1 minutes, only forty-three
per cent of the previous average of 4.8 minutes.
It is noteworthy that the curve (see <a href=#Figure_29>Fig. 29</a>),

<p>In the foregoing instance it is noteworthy that
the degree of acceleration is not so great after the
second stimulation of the splanchnics as it was
after the first. This reduction of effect as the
nerves were repeatedly stimulated was frequently
noted. The following case presents another illustration:</p>

<p>Nov. 12.&mdash;A cat was etherized (2.35 p.m.) and
the medulla was punctured (piqûre) at 3.12. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>
operation was without effect. The loss or lessening
of effectiveness on second stimulation of the
left splanchnic nerves is to be compared with the
persistence of effectiveness on the right side:</p>

<p>The experiments above recorded show that
stimulation of the splanchnic nerves results immediately,
or after a brief period, in a shortening of
the coagulation time of the blood&mdash;an effect which
in different animals varies in duration and intensity,
and diminishes as the stimulation is repeated.
The next question was whether this effect is produced
through the adrenal glands.</p>

<span class="smcap">Figure 31.</span>&mdash;Results of stimulating the left splanchnic nerves,

right adrenal gland present.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Elliott’s evidence that in the cat the splanchnic
innervation of the adrenals is not crossed has already
been mentioned. If the gland is removed on
one side, therefore, stimulation of the nerves on
that side causes no discharge from the opposite
gland. As the above experiments clearly show,
splanchnic stimulation on the glandless side results
in no shortening of the coagulation time; whereas,
in the same animals, stimulation of the nerves on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span>
the other side (still connected with the adrenal
gland) produces a sharp hastening of the clotting
process.</p>

<p>The splanchnics innervate the intestines and
liver even though the adrenal gland is removed.
The foregoing experiments indicate that the nerve
impulses delivered to these organs do not influence
them in any direct manner to accelerate the speed
of coagulation. Indeed, in one of the experiments
(Dec. 4, see <a href=#Figure_31>Fig. 31</a>) a high reading about ten minutes
after splanchnic stimulation on the glandless
side suggests the possibility of an opposite effect.
Direct stimulation of the hepatic nerves on one
occasion was followed by a change of the clotting
time from 4.5, 5, 4.5, 4.5 minutes during twenty-five
minutes before stimulation to 4.5, 7, and 6 minutes
during twenty minutes after stimulation.</p>

<p>Since with the adrenals present stimulation of
hepatic nerves induces alteration of glycogen in the
liver and quick increase of blood <span class="nowrap">sugar,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> just as
splanchnic stimulation does, the failure of the
blood to clot faster after stimulation of the hepatic
nerves confirms the evidence already offered that
faster clotting when adrenin is increased in the
blood is not due to a larger amount of sugar present
(see <a href=#Page_159>p. 159</a>).</p>

<p>The liver and intestines cannot be made to
shorten clotting time by stimulation of their
nerves, but, as has already been shown (see <a href=#Page_157>p. 157</a>),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span>
neither can adrenin act by itself to hasten the clotting
process. Apparently the effect is produced by
coöperation between the adrenals and the liver
(and possibly also the intestines). Somewhat similar
coöperation is noted in the organization of
sugar metabolism; splanchnic stimulation in the
absence of the adrenal glands does not increase
blood <span class="nowrap">sugar,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> and in the absence of the liver adrenin
is without <span class="nowrap">influence.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The variations of effect noted after splanchnic
stimulation can be accounted for by variations
in the adrenin content of the glands. <span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
found, as previously stated, that animals newly
brought into strange surroundings may have a considerably
reduced amount of adrenin in their adrenals.
The animals used in our experiments had
been for varying lengths of time in an animal
house in which barking dogs were also kept, and
were therefore subject to influences which would be
likely to discharge the glands.</p>

<p>The evidence that stimulation of splanchnic
nerves, with accompanying increase of adrenal
secretion, results in more rapid clotting of blood is
especially interesting in relation to the experiments
previously described, which showed that in pain
and emotional excitement there is an increased
secretion of adrenin into the blood. Does the adrenin
thus liberated have any effect on the rate of
coagulation? The observations here recorded were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span>
made in order to obtain an answer to that question.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coagulation Hastened by “Painful” Stimulation</span></h3>

<p>In the experiments on the action of stimuli
which in the unanesthetized animal would cause
pain, it will be recalled that faradic stimulation of
a large nerve trunk (the stump of the cut sciatic)
and operation under light anesthesia were the
methods used to affect the afferent nerves. <span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
found that repeated excitation of the sciatic
nerve was especially efficient in exhausting the
adrenal glands of their adrenin content, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span>
that this reflex persisted after removal of the cerebral
hemispheres. It was to be expected, therefore,
that with well-stored glands, sciatic stimulation,
even in the decerebrate animal, would call
forth an amount of adrenal secretion which would
decidedly hasten clotting. The following case illustrates
such a result:</p>

<p>Dec. 12.&mdash;A cat was anesthetized with ether at
3.45 and the left sciatic nerve was bared. Decerebration
was completed at 3.57. The clotting time
of the blood began to be tested six minutes later:</p>

<p>The results obtained in this case, which were
similar to results in other cases, are represented
graphically in <a href=#Figure_32>Fig. 32</a>. The coagulation time
was becoming gradually more prolonged, but
each excitation of the sciatic nerve was followed
by a marked shortening. The strength of stimulation
was not determined with exactness, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>
is worthy of note that the current used in the
first and the third stimulations was weaker than
could be felt on the tongue, whereas that used in
the second was considerably stronger, though it
did not produce reflex spasms.</p>

<p>In the foregoing and in other similar instances,
a condition of surgical injury, whether just made
or being made, was accompanied by more rapid
clotting of blood when the degree of anesthesia was
lessened. This condition was one which, if allowed
to go further in the same direction, would result
in pain. Both direct electrical stimulation and also
surgical operation of a nature to give pain in the
unanesthetized animal result, therefore, in faster
clotting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span></p>

<p>It is worthy of note that after decerebration clotting
apparently occurred no faster because the abdomen
had been opened, although in the decerebrate
state etherization was suspended. The
mechanism for reflex control of the adrenals may
not be higher than the corpora quadrigemina, as
Elliott has shown, but the discharge from the
glands seems to be more certain to occur when the
cerebrum is present and is permitted even slightly
to operate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coagulation Hastened in Emotional Excitement</span></h3>

<p>The evidence for emotional secretion of the adrenal
glands has already been presented. As was
noted in my earlier observations on the motions of
the alimentary canal (see <a href=#Page_14>p. 14</a>), cats differ widely
in their emotional reaction to being bound; some,
especially young males, become furious; others,
especially elderly females, take the experience
quite calmly. This difference of attitude was used
with positive results, the reader will recall, in the
experiments on emotional glycosuria; there seemed
a possibility likewise of using it to test the effect
of emotions on blood clotting. To plan formal experiments
for that purpose was not necessary, because
in the ordinary course of the researches here
reported, the difference in effects on the blood between
the violent rage of vigorous young males and
the quiet complacency of old females was early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>
noted. Indeed, the rapid clotting which accompanied
excitement not infrequently made necessary
an annoying wait till slower clotting would permit
the use of experimental methods for shortening the
process.</p>

<p>The animals used on November 11 and 13 (<a href=#Page_175>see
pp. 175</a>, 176) are examples of calm acceptance of
being placed on the holder; and furthermore, these
animals were anesthetized without much disturbance.
As the figures indicate, the clotting
from the first occurred at about the average rate.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to these figures are those obtained
when a vigorous animal is angered:</p>

<p>Oct. 30.&mdash;A very vigorous cat was placed on the
holder at 9.08. It at once became stormy, snarling,
hissing, biting, and lashing its big tail. At 9.12
etherizing was begun and that intensified the excitement.
By 9.15 the femoral artery was tied.
The clotting time of the blood for an hour after the
ether was first given was as follows:</p>

<p>Twenty-four observations made during the hour
showed that the clotting time in this enraged animal
averaged three-fourths of a minute and was
never longer than a minute and a half. The clots
were invariably a solid jelly. The persistence of
the rapid clotting for so long a period after anesthesia
was started may have been in part due to
continued, rather light, etherization, for <span class="nowrap">Elliott<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
found that etherization itself could reduce the
adrenin content of the adrenal glands.</p>

<p>The shortened clotting did not always persist so
long as in the foregoing instance. The brief period
of faster clotting illustrated in the following case
was typical of many:</p>

<p>Nov. 18.&mdash;A cat that had been in stock for some
time was placed on the holder at 2.13, and was at
once enraged. Two minutes later etherization was
started. The hairs on the tail were erect. The
clotting was as follows:</p>

<p>It seems probable that in this case just as in
some of the cases in which the splanchnic nerves
were stimulated (see <a href=#Page_166>p. 166</a>), the adrenals had been
well-nigh exhausted because of the cat’s being
caged near dogs, and that the emotional flare-up
practically discharged the glands, for repeated attempts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span>
later to reproduce the initial rapid clotting
by stimulation of the splanchnic nerves were without
result.</p>

<p>Evidence presented in previous chapters makes
wholly probable the correctness of the inference
that the faster coagulation which follows emotional
excitement is due to adrenal discharge from
splanchnic stimulation. In this relation the effect
of severance of the splanchnics on emotional acceleration
of the clotting process is of interest. The
following cases are illustrative:</p>

<p>Oct. 29.&mdash;A cat was left on the holder for ten
minutes while the femoral artery was uncovered
under local anesthesia. The blood removed was
clotted in a half-minute. The animal was much
excited. It was now quickly etherized and the
brain pithed forward from the neck. The tests
resulted as follows:</p>

<p>In this instance the subsequent stimulation of
the splanchnic nerves resulted again in faster clotting&mdash;a
reduction from 5.5 minutes to 3.5 minutes
(see experiment Nov. 7, <a href=#Page_164>p. 164</a>). The results from

</figure>

<p>The data presented in this chapter show that
such stimulation as in the unanesthetized animal
would cause pain, and also such emotions as fear
and rage, are capable of greatly shortening the
coagulation time of blood. These results are quite
in harmony with the evidence previously offered
that injected adrenin and secretion from the adrenal
glands induced by splanchnic stimulation
hasten clotting, for painful stimulation and emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>
excitement also evoke activity of the adrenals.
Here, then, is another fundamental change
in the body, a change tending to the conservation
of its most important fluid, wrought through the
adrenal glands in times of great perturbation.
This bodily change and the others which occur
under the same circumstances are next to be examined
with reference to their significance.</p>

<p class="center">THE UTILITY OF THE BODILY CHANGES IN
PAIN AND GREAT EMOTION</p>

<p class="sp2">We now turn from a consideration of the data
secured in our experiments to an interpretation of
the data. One of the most important lessons of experience
is learning to distinguish between the
facts of observation and the inferences drawn from
those facts. The facts may remain unquestioned;
the explanation, however, may be changed by additional
facts or through the influence of more extensive
views. Having given this warning, I propose
to discuss the bearings of the results reported
in the earlier chapters.</p>

<p>Our inquiry thus far has revealed that the
adrenin secreted by the adrenal glands in times of
stress has all the effects in the body that are produced
by injected adrenin. It plays an essential
rôle in calling forth stored carbohydrate from the
liver, thus flooding the blood with sugar; it helps
in distributing the blood to the heart, lungs, central
nervous system and limbs, while taking it away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
from the inhibited organs of the abdomen; it
quickly abolishes the effects of muscular fatigue;
and it renders the blood more rapidly coagulable.
These remarkable facts are, furthermore, associated
with some of the most primitive experiences
in the life of higher organisms, experiences common
to all, both man and beast&mdash;the elemental
experiences of pain and fear and rage that come
suddenly in critical emergencies. What is the significance
of these profound bodily alterations?
What are the <em>emergency functions</em> of secreted
adrenin?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Reflex Nature of Bodily Responses in Pain and
the Major Emotions, and the Useful Character
of Reflexes</span></h3>

<p>The most significant feature of these bodily reactions
in pain and in the presence of emotion-provoking
objects is that they are of the nature
of reflexes&mdash;they are not willed movements, indeed
they are often distressingly beyond the control
of the will. The pattern of the reaction, in these
as in other reflexes, is deeply inwrought in the
workings of the nervous system, and when the
appropriate occasion arises, typical organic responses
are evoked through inherent automatisms.</p>

<p>It has long been recognized that the most characteristic
feature of reflexes is their “purposive”
nature, or their utility either in preserving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>
welfare of the organism or in safeguarding it
against injury. The reflexes of sucking, swallowing,
vomiting and coughing, for instance, need
only to be mentioned to indicate the variety of
ways in which reflexes favor the continuance of
existence. When, therefore, these automatic responses
accompanying pain and fear and rage&mdash;the
increased discharge of adrenin and sugar&mdash;are
under consideration, it is reasonable to inquire
first as to their utility.</p>

<p>Numerous ingenious suggestions have been offered
to account for the more obvious changes
accompanying emotional states&mdash;as, for example,
the terrifying aspect produced by the bristling of
the hair and the uncovering of the teeth in an
access of <span class="nowrap">rage.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> The most widely applicable explanation
proposed for these spontaneous reactions
is that during the long course of racial
experience they have been developed for quick
service in the struggle for existence. Earlier
writers on organic evolution pointed out the anticipatory
character of these responses. According to
<span class="nowrap">Spencer,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> “Fear, when strong, expresses itself
in cries, in efforts to hide or escape, in palpitations
and tremblings; and these are just the manifestations
that would accompany an actual experience
of the evil feared. The destructive passions are
shown in a general tension of the muscular system,
in gnashing of the teeth and protrusion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>
claws, in dilated eyes and nostrils, in growls; and
these are weaker forms of the actions that accompany
the killing of prey.” <span class="nowrap">McDougall<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> has developed
this idea systematically and has suggested
that an association has become established between
peculiar emotions and peculiar instinctive reactions;
thus the emotion of fear is associated with
the instinct for flight, and the emotion of anger
or rage with the instinct for fighting or attack.
<span class="nowrap">Crile<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> likewise in giving recent expression to
the same view has emphasized the importance
of adaptation and natural selection, operative
through myriads of years of racial experience, in
enabling us to account for the already channeled
responses which we find established in our nervous
organization. And on a principle of “phylogenetic
association” he assumes that fear, born of innumerable
injuries in the course of evolution, has developed
into portentous foreshadowing of possible
injury and has become, therefore, capable of arousing
in the body all the offensive and defensive
activities that favor the survival of the organism.</p>

<p>Because the increase of adrenin and the increase
of sugar in the blood, following painful or strong
emotional experiences, are reflex in character, and
because reflexes as a rule are useful responses,
we are justified in the assumption that under these
circumstances these reactions are useful. What,
then, is their possible value?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span></p>

<p>In order that these reactions may be useful
they must be <em>prompt</em>. Such is the case. Some
observations made by one of my students, Mr. H.
Osgood, show that the latent period of adrenal
secretion, when the splanchnic nerve is stimulated
below the diaphragm, is not longer than 16 seconds;
and <span class="nowrap">Macleod<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> states that within a few minutes
after splanchnic stimulation the sugar in the
blood rises between 10 and 30 per cent. The two
secretions are, therefore, almost instantly ready
for service.</p>

<p>Conceivably the two secretions might act in conjunction,
or each might have its own function alone.
Thus adrenin might serve in coöperation with
nervous excitement to produce increase of blood
sugar, or it might have that function and other
functions quite apart from that. Before these
possibilities are considered, however, the value of
the increased blood sugar itself will be discussed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Utility of the Increased Blood Sugar as a Source of
Muscular Energy</span></h3>

<p>When we were working on emotional glycosuria
a clue to the significance of the increase of sugar in
the blood was found in McDougall’s suggestion of
a relation between “flight instinct” and “fear
emotion,” and “pugnacity instinct” and “anger
emotion.” And the point was made that, since
the fear emotion and the anger emotion are, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>
wild life, likely to be followed by activities (running
or fighting) which require contraction of great
muscular masses in supreme and prolonged struggle,
a mobilization of sugar in the blood might be
of signal service to the laboring muscles. Pain&mdash;and
fighting is almost certain to involve pain&mdash;would,
if possible, call forth even greater muscular
effort. “In the agony of pain almost every muscle
of the body is brought into strong action,” <span class="nowrap">Darwin<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
wrote, for “great pain urges all animals,
and has urged them during endless generations,
to make the most violent and diversified efforts
to escape from the cause of <span class="nowrap">suffering.”<a id="SNanchor_13" href="#Starnote_13" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Starnote_13" href="#SNanchor_13" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  It is recognized that both pain and the major emotions
may have at times depressive rather than stimulating effects.
For example, Martin and Lacey have shown (American Journal
of Physiology, 1914, <abbr title="33">xxxiii</abbr>, p. 212) that such stimuli as
would induce pain may cause a fall of blood pressure, and
they suggest that the rise of blood pressure commonly reported
at times of painful experience is due to the psychic disturbance
that is simultaneously aroused. Conceivably there
is a relation between recognizing the possibility of escape
(with the psychic consequences of that possibility) and the
degree of stimulating effect. Thus pains originating from
the interior of the body, or from injuries sure to be made
more painful by action, would not likely lead to action. On
the other hand, the whip and spur illustrate the well-known
excitant effect of painful stimuli.</p>

<p>Similarly in the case of the strong emotions, the effect may
be paralyzing until there is a <em>definite deed to perform</em>. Thus
terror may be the most depressing of all emotions, but, as Darwin
pointed out (<i><abbr title="Work already cited">Loc. cit.</abbr></i>, p. 81), “a man or animal driven
through terror to desperation is endowed with wonderful
strength, and is notoriously dangerous in the highest degree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span></p>

<p>That muscular work is performed by energy
supplied in carbonaceous material is shown by the
great increase of carbon-dioxide output in severe
muscular work, which may exceed twenty times
the output during rest. Furthermore, the storage
of glycogen in muscle, and the disappearance of
this glycogen deposit from excised muscle stimulated
to <span class="nowrap">activity,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> or its reduction after excessive
contractions produced by <span class="nowrap">strychnine,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> and the
lessened ability of muscles to work if their glycogen
store has been <span class="nowrap">reduced,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> and the simple
chemical relation between sugar and the lactic acid
which appears when muscles are repeatedly made
to contract, are all indications that carbohydrate
(sugar and glycogen) is the elective source of energy
for contraction. This conclusion is supported
in recent careful studies by Benedict
and <span class="nowrap">Cathcart,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> who have shown that a small but
distinct increase in the ratio between the carbon-dioxide
breathed out and the oxygen breathed in
during a given period (the respiratory quotient)
occurs during muscular work, and that a decrease
in the quotient follows, thus pointing to a larger
proportion of carbohydrate burned during muscular
work than before or after&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, a call on the
carbohydrate deposits of the body.</p>

<p>Whether circulating sugar can be immediately
utilized by active muscles has been a subject of dispute.
The claim of Chauveau and Kaufmann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
that a muscle uses about three and a half times
as much blood sugar when active as when resting,
although supported by <span class="nowrap">Quinquaud,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> and
by Morat and <span class="nowrap">Dufourt,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> has been denied by
<span class="nowrap">Pavy,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> who failed to find any difference between
the sugar content of arterial and venous
blood when the muscle was contracting; and also
by <span class="nowrap">Magnus-Levy,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> who has estimated that the
amount of change in sugar content of the blood
passing through a muscle must be so slight as to
be within the limits of the error of analysis. On
the other hand, when blood or Ringer’s solution
is repeatedly perfused through contracting heart
muscle, the evidence is clear that the contained
sugar may more or less completely disappear.
Thus Locke and <span class="nowrap">Rosenheim<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> found that from
5 to 10 centigrams of dextrose disappeared from
Ringer’s solution repeatedly circulated through
the rabbit heart for eight or nine hours. And
recently Patterson and <span class="nowrap">Starling<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> have shown
that if blood is perfused repeatedly through a
heart-lung preparation for three or four hours,
and the heart is continually stimulated by adrenin
added to the blood, the sugar in the blood wholly
vanishes; or if the supply of sugar is maintained,
the consumption may rise as high as 8 milligrams
per gram of heart muscle per hour&mdash;about four
times the usual consumption. When an animal is
eviscerated it may be regarded as a preparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span>
in which the muscles are perfused with their proper
blood, pumped by the heart and oxygenated by
the lungs. Under these circumstances, the percentage
of sugar in the blood steadily <span class="nowrap">falls,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
because the utilization by the tissues is not compensated
for by further supply from the liver.
Thus, although there may be doubt that analyses
of sugar in the blood flowing into and out from
an active muscle during a brief period can be accurate
enough to prove a clear difference, the evidence
from the experiments above cited shows that
when the supply of sugar is limited it disappears
to a greater or less degree when passed repeatedly
through muscular organs.</p>

<p>The argument may be advanced, of course, that
the sugar which thus disappears is not directly
utilized, but must first be changed to glycogen.
There is little basis for this assumption. There
is, on the other hand, considerable evidence that
increasing the blood sugar does, in fact, directly
increase muscular efficiency. Thus <span class="nowrap">Locke<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> proved
that if oxygenated salt solution is perfused
through the isolated rabbit heart, the beats begin
to weaken after one or two hours; but if now 0.1
per cent dextrose is added to the perfusing liquid,
the beats at once become markedly stronger and
may continue with very slow lessening of strength
as long as seven hours. And <span class="nowrap">Schumberg<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> noted
that when he performed a large amount of general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span>
bodily work (thus using up blood sugar)
and then tested flexion of the middle finger in an
ergograph, the ability of the muscle was greater
if he drank a sugar solution than if he drank an
equally sweet solution of “dulcin.” He did not
know during the experiment which solution he was
drinking. These observations have been confirmed
by Prantner and Stowasser, and by <span class="nowrap">Frentzel.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
In experiments on cats, Lee and <span class="nowrap">Harrold<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> found
that when sugar is removed from the animal by
means of phlorhizin the <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i> is quickly
fatigued; but if, after the phlorhizin treatment,
the animal is given an abundance of sugar and then
submitted to the test, the muscle shows a much
larger capacity for work. All this evidence is,
of course, favorable to the view that circulating
sugar may be quickly utilized by contracting
muscles.</p>

<p>From the experimental results presented above
it is clear that muscles work preferably by utilizing
the energy stored in sugar, that great muscular
labor is capable of considerably reducing the quantity
of stored glycogen and of circulating sugar,
and that under circumstances of a lessened sugar
content the increase of blood sugar considerably
augments the ability of muscles to continue contracting.
The conclusion seems justified, therefore,
that the increased blood sugar attendant on
the major emotions and pain would be of direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span>
benefit to the organism in the strenuous muscular
efforts involved in flight or conflict or struggle to
be free.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Utility of Increased Adrenin in the Blood as an
Antidote to the Effects of Fatigue</span></h3>

<p>The function which the discharged adrenin itself
might have in favoring vigorous muscular contraction
has already been suggested in the chapter
on the effect of adrenin in restoring the irritability
of fatigued muscle. Some of the earliest evidence
proved that removal of the adrenal glands has a
debilitating effect on muscular power, and that
injection of adrenal extract has an invigorating
effect. For these reasons it seemed possible that
increased adrenal secretion, as a reflex result of
pain or the major emotions, might act in itself as
a dynamogenic factor in the performance of muscular
work. It was on the basis of that possibility
that Nice and I tested the effect of stimulating
the splanchnic nerves (thus causing adrenal secretion),
or injecting adrenin, on the contraction of
the fatigued <i lang="la">tibialis anticus</i>. We found, as already
described, that when arterial pressure was of normal
height, and was prevented from rising in the
legs while the splanchnic was being stimulated,
there was a distinct rise in the height of contraction
of the fatigued muscle. And we drew the
inference that adrenin set free in the blood may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span>
operate favorably to the organism by preparing
fatigued muscles for better response to the nervous
discharges sent forth in great excitement.</p>

<p>This inference led to the experiments by Gruber,
who examined the effects of minute amounts of
adrenin (0.1 or 0.5 cubic centimeter, 1:100,000),
and also of splanchnic stimulation, on the threshold
stimulus of fatigued neuro-muscular and muscular
apparatus. Fatigue, the reader will recall,
raises the threshold not uncommonly 100 or 200
per cent, and in some instances as much as 600 per
cent. Rest will restore the normal threshold in
periods varying from fifteen minutes to two hours,
according to the length of previous stimulation.
If a small dose of adrenin is given, however, the
normal threshold may be restored in three to five
minutes.</p>

<p>From the foregoing evidence the conclusion is
warranted that adrenin, when freely liberated in
the blood, not only aids in bringing out sugar from
the liver’s store of glycogen, but also has a remarkable
influence in quickly restoring to fatigued muscles,
which have lost their original irritability, the
same readiness for response which they had when
fresh. Thus the adrenin set free in pain and in
fear and rage would put the muscles of the body
unqualifiedly at the disposal of the nervous system;
the difficulty which nerve impulses might
have in calling the muscles into full activity would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>
be practically abolished; and this provision, along
with the abundance of energy-supplying sugar
newly flushed into the circulation, would give to
the animal in which these mechanisms are most
efficient the best possible conditions for putting
forth supreme muscular <span class="nowrap">efforts.<a id="SNanchor_14" href="#Starnote_14" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_14" href="#SNanchor_14" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  If these results of emotion and pain are not “worked off”
by action, it is conceivable that the excessive adrenin and
sugar in the blood may have pathological effects. (<abbr title="Compare">Cf.</abbr> Cannon:

p. 742.)</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Question Whether Adrenin Normally Secreted
Inhibits the Use of Sugar in the Body</span></h3>

<p>The only evidence opposed to the conclusion
which has just been drawn is that which may be
found in results recently reported by Wilenko. He
injected adrenin into urethanized rabbits, usually
one milligram per kilo body weight, and then found
that the animals did not oxidize any part of an
intravenous injection of glucose. Rabbits supplied
with glucose in a similar manner, but not given
adrenin, have an increased respiratory quotient.
<span class="nowrap">Wilenko<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> concluded, therefore, that adrenin lessens
the capacity of the organism to burn carbohydrates.
In a later paper he reported that adrenin,
when added, with glucose, to physiological salt
solution (Locke’s), and perfused through the isolated
rabbit heart, notably increases the use of
sugar by the heart (from 2.2&ndash;2.8 to 2.9&ndash;4.3 milligrams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>
of glucose per gram of heart muscle per
hour), but that the heart removed after the animal
has received a subcutaneous injection of adrenin
uses much less sugar, only 0.5&ndash;1.2 milligrams
per gram per hour. From these results <span class="nowrap">Wilenko<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
concludes that the glycosuria following injection
of adrenin is the result of disturbance of
the use of sugar&mdash;an effect which is not direct on
the sugar-consuming organ, but indirect through
action on some other organ.</p>

<p>Wilenko’s conclusion fails to account readily for
the disappearance of glycogen from the liver in
adrenin glycosuria. Furthermore, <span class="nowrap">Lusk<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span> has
recently reported that the subcutaneous administration
of adrenin (one milligram per kilo body
weight) to dogs, simultaneously with 50 grams of
glucose by mouth, interferes not at all with the
use of the sugar&mdash;the respiratory quotient remains
for several hours at 1.0; <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, at the figure which
glucose alone would have given. In other words,
Lusk’s results with dogs are directly contradictory
to Wilenko’s results with rabbits. Nevertheless,
Wilenko’s conclusion might be quite true for the
glycosuria produced by adrenin alone (which must
be excessive), and yet have no bearing whatever
on the glycosuria produced physiologically by
splanchnic stimulation, even though some adrenin
is thereby simultaneously liberated.</p>

<p>The amount of injected adrenin used to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>
adrenin glycosuria is enormous. Osgood has studied
in the Harvard Physiological Laboratory the
effects on blood pressure of alternately stimulating
the left splanchnic nerves (with the splanchnic
vessels eliminated) and injecting adrenin, and by
this method of <span class="nowrap">comparison<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> has shown that
the amount secreted after five seconds of stimulation
varies between 0.0015 and 0.007 milligram. If
0.005 milligram is taken as a rather high average
figure, and doubled (for two glands), the amount
would be 0.01 milligram. To produce adrenin glycosuria,
an animal weighing two kilos would be
injected with two hundred times this amount. It
is granted that more adrenin would be secreted if
the nerves were stimulated longer than five seconds,
and that with injection under the skin or into
the abdominal cavity (to produce glycosuria), the
amount of adrenin in the blood at one time would
not be so great as if the injection were into a vein;
but even with these concessions the amount of adrenin
in the blood, when it has been injected to
produce glycosuria, is probably very much above
the amount following physiological stimulation of
the glands.</p>

<p>Other evidence that the amount of adrenin discharged
when the glands are stimulated is not so
great as the amount needed to produce glycosuria
when acting alone is presented in experiments by
<span class="nowrap">Macleod.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span> He found that if the nerve fibres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>
to the liver were destroyed, stimulation of the
splanchnic, which would cause increased adrenal
secretion, did not increase the blood sugar. The
increased blood sugar due to splanchnic stimulation,
therefore, is a nervous effect, dependent, to
be sure, on the presence of adrenin in the blood,
but the amount of adrenin present is not in itself
capable of evoking increase.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the increased blood sugar following
splanchnic stimulation may long outlast the
stimulation period. The adrenals, however, as has
been demonstrated by Osgood, are soon fatigued,
and fail to respond to repeated stimulation. They
seem to be incapable of prolonged action.</p>

<p>Again, as <span class="nowrap">Macleod<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> has shown, a rise in the
sugar content of the blood can be induced, if the
adrenals are intact, merely by stimulating the
nerves going to the liver. The increased blood
sugar of splanchnic origin, therefore, is not due to
a disturbance of the <em>use</em> of sugar in the body, as
Wilenko claims for the increase after adrenin injection,
but is a result of a breaking down of the
stored glycogen in the liver and is of nervous
origin.</p>

<p>We may conclude, therefore, that since the conditions
of Wilenko’s observations are not comparable
with emotional conditions, his inferences are
not pertinent to the present discussion; that when
both adrenin and sugar are increased in the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span>
as a result of excitement, the higher percentage
of sugar is not due to adrenin inhibiting the use
of sugar by the tissues, and that there is no evidence
at present to show that the brief augmentation
of adrenal discharge, following excitement or
splanchnic stimulation, affects in any deleterious
manner the utilization of sugar as a source of energy.
Indeed, the observation of Wilenko and of
Patterson and Starling, above mentioned, that adrenin
increases the use of sugar by the heart, may
signify that a <em>physiological</em> discharge of the adrenals
can have a favorable rather than an unfavorable
effect on the employment of sugar by the
tissues.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Vascular Changes Produced by Adrenin Favorable to
Supreme Muscular Exertion</span></h3>

<p>Quite in harmony with the foregoing argument
that sugar and adrenin, which are poured into the
blood during emotional excitement, render the organism
more efficient in the physical struggle for
existence, are the vascular changes wrought by
increased adrenin, probably in coöperation with
sympathetic innervations. The studies of volume
changes of parts of the body, made by Oliver and
Schäfer, have already been mentioned. Their observations,
it will be remembered, showed that
injected adrenin drove the blood from the abdominal
viscera into the organs called upon in emergencies&mdash;into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span>
the central nervous system, the
lungs, the heart, and the active skeletal muscles.
The absence of effective vasoconstrictor nerves
in the brain and the lungs, and the dilation of
vessels in the heart and skeletal muscles during
times of increased activity, make the blood supply
to these parts dependent on the height of general
arterial pressure. In pain and great excitement,
as we have already noted, this pressure is likely
to be much elevated, and consequently the blood
flow through the unconstricted or actually dilated
vessels of the body will be all the more abundant.</p>

<p>Adrenin has a well-known stimulating effect on
the isolated heart&mdash;causing an increase both in the
rate and the amplitude of cardiac contraction. This
effect accords with the general rule that adrenin
simulates the action of sympathetic impulses. It
is commonly stated, however, that if the heart
holds its normal relations in the body, adrenin
causes slowing of the <span class="nowrap">beat.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> This view is doubtless
due to the massive doses that have been
employed, which are quite beyond physiological
limits and which induce such enormous increases
of arterial pressure that the natural influence of
adrenin on heart muscle is overcome by mechanical
obstacles to quick contractions and by inhibitory
impulses from the central nervous system. Hoskins
and Lovellette have recently shown that when
the precaution is taken to inject adrenin into a vein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>
in a manner resembling the discharge from the
adrenal glands, not only is there increased blood
pressure, but generally, also, an acceleration of the
<span class="nowrap">pulse.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span> At the same time, therefore, that a
greater amount of work, from increased arterial
pressure, is demanded of the heart, blood is delivered
to the heart in greater abundance, and the
muscle is excited to more rapid and vigorous pulsations.
The augmentation of the heart beat is
thus coördinate with the other adaptive functions
of the adrenal glands in great emergencies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Changes in Respiratory Function Also Favorable
to Great Effort</span></h3>

<p>The urgent need in struggle or flight is a generous
supply of oxygen to oxidize the metabolites
of muscular contraction, and a quick riddance of
the resultant carbon-dioxide from the body. The
moment vigorous exercise is begun the breathing
at once changes so as to bring about a more thorough
ventilation of the lungs. And one of the most
characteristic reactions of animals in pain and
emotional excitement is deep and rapid respiration.
Again the reflex response is precisely what would
be most serviceable to the organism in the strenuous
efforts of fighting or escape that might accompany
or follow distress or fear or rage. It is
known that by such forced respirations the carbon-dioxide
content of the blood can be so much reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span>
that the need for any breathing whatever
may be deferred for as much as a minute or
even <span class="nowrap">longer.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> And Douglas and <span class="nowrap">Haldane<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span> have
found that moderately forced breathing for three
minutes previous to severe muscular exertion results
in greatly diminishing the subsequent respiratory
distress, as well as lessening the amount
of air breathed and the amount of carbon-dioxide
given off. Furthermore, the heart beats less rapidly
after the performance and returns more
quickly from its increased rate to normal. The
forced respirations in deeply emotional experiences
can be interpreted, therefore, as an anticipatory
reduction of the carbon-dioxide in the blood,
a preparation for the augmented discharge of
carbon-dioxide into the blood as soon as great
muscular exertion <span class="nowrap">begins.<a id="SNanchor_15" href="#Starnote_15" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_15" href="#SNanchor_15" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The excessive production of heat in muscular work gives
rise to sweating. The evaporation of sweat helps to keep the
body temperature from rising unduly from the heat of exertion.
Again in strong emotion and in pain the “cold sweat”
that appears on the skin may be regarded as a reaction
anticipatory of the strenuous muscular movements that are
likely to ensue.</p>
</div>

<p>As the air moves to and fro in the lungs with
each respiration, it must pass through the fine
divisions of the air tubes or bronchioles. The
bronchioles are provided with smooth muscle,
which, in all probability, like smooth muscle elsewhere
in the body, is normally held in a state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>
tonic contraction. When this tonic contraction is
much increased, as in asthma, breathing becomes
difficult, and even with the body at rest unusual
effort is then required to maintain the minimal
necessary ventilation of the lungs. During strenuous
exertion, with each breath the air must rush
through the bronchioles in greatly increased volume
and speed. Thus in a well person “winded”
with running, for example, the bronchioles might
become <em>relatively</em> too small for the stream of air,
just as they are too small in a person ill with
asthma. And then some extra energy would have
to be expended to force the air back and forth with
sufficient rapidity to satisfy the bodily needs. It
is probable that even under the most favorable conditions,
the labored breathing in hard exercise involves
to some degree the work of accelerating the
tidal flow of the respiratory gases. This extra
labor would obviously be reduced, if the tonic contraction
of the ring-muscles in the wall of the
bronchioles was reduced, so that the tubules were
enlarged. It has been shown by a number of investigators,
who have used various methods, that
adrenin injected into the blood stream has as one
of its precise actions the dilating of the <span class="nowrap">bronchioles.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
The adrenin discharged in emotional excitement
goes to the lungs before entering into
relation with any other organ except the right
heart chamber; it may, therefore, have as its first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
effect the relaxation of the smooth muscles of the
lungs. This would be another very direct means
of rendering the organism more efficient when
fierce struggle calls for a bounteous supply of fresh
air and a speedy discharge of the carbonaceous
waste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Effects Produced in Asphyxia Similar to Those Produced
in Pain and Excitement</span></h3>

<p>All the bodily responses occurring in pain and
emotional excitement have thus far been considered
as <em>anticipatory</em> of the instinctive acts which
naturally follow. And as we have seen, these responses
can reasonably be interpreted as preparatory
to the great exertions which may be demanded
of the organism. This interpretation of
the facts is supported by the discovery that a
mechanism exists whereby the changes initiated
in an anticipatory manner by emotional excitement
are continued or perhaps augmented by the
exertion itself.</p>

<p>Great exertion, such as might attend flight or
conflict, would result in an excessive production of
carbon-dioxide. Then, although respiratory and
circulatory changes of emotional origin may have
prepared the body for struggle, the emotional provisions
for keeping the working parts at a high
level of efficiency may not continue to operate, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span>
they may not be adequate. If there is painful gasping
for breath in the course of prolonged and vigorous
exertion, or for a considerable period after
the work has ceased, a condition of partial
asphyxia has evidently been induced. This condition,
as everyone knows, is distinctly unfavorable
to further effort. But the asphyxia itself may act
as a <span class="nowrap">stimulus.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In our examination of the influence of various
conditions on the secretion of the adrenal glands,
Hoskins and <span class="nowrap">I<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> tested the effects of asphyxia.
By use of the intestinal segment as an indicator we
compared the action of blood, taken as nearly simultaneously
as possible from the vena cava above
the adrenal vessels and from the femoral vein before
asphyxia, with blood taken from the same
sources after asphyxia had been produced. The
femoral venous blood after passing the capillaries
of the leg thus acted as a standard for the same
blood after receiving the contribution of the
adrenal veins. Asphyxia was caused by covering
the tracheal cannula until respiration became
labored and slow, but capable of recovery when air
was admitted. It may be regarded, therefore, as
not extreme.</p>

<p>The results of the degree of asphyxia above
described are shown by graphic record in <a href=#Figure_36>Fig. 36</a>.
Blood taken from the vena cava and from the
femoral vein before asphyxia (“normal”) failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span>
cause inhibition of the contractions. Blood taken
from the femoral vein after asphyxia produced almost
the same effect as blood from the same vein
before; asphyxia, therefore, had wrought no
change demonstrable in the general venous flow.
Blood taken from the vena cava after asphyxia
had, on the contrary, an effect markedly unlike
blood from the same region before (compare the
record after 1 and after 7, <a href=#Figure_36>Fig. 36</a>)&mdash;it caused the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>
typical inhibition which indicates the presence of
adrenal <span class="nowrap">secretion.<a id="SNanchor_16" href="#Starnote_16" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

femoral vein after asphyxia applied, at 6 removed.
At 7 blood from the vena cava after
asphyxia applied. Time, half-minutes.

<p><a id="Starnote_16" href="#SNanchor_16" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  This positive result might suggest that the comparison of
both femoral and vena-cava blood under each condition was
unnecessary, and that a comparison merely of vena-cava
blood before and after asphyxia would be sufficient. Positive
results were indeed thus secured, but they occurred even
when the adrenal glands were carefully removed and extreme
asphyxia (<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, stoppage of respiration) was induced. That
the blood may contain in extreme asphyxia a substance or
substances capable of causing inhibition of intestinal contractions
was thus demonstrated. In one instance, after the
blood was proved free from adrenin, the aorta and vena cava
were tied close below the diaphragm, and the carotids were
tied about midway in the neck. Extreme asphyxia was
produced (lasting five minutes). Blood now taken from the
heart caused marked inhibition of the beating intestinal
segment. Probably, therefore, the inhibitory action of blood
taken from an animal when <em>extremely</em> asphyxiated cannot be
due to adrenin alone.</p>
</div>

<p>That the positive result obtained in moderate
asphyxia is not attributable to other agencies in
the blood than adrenin is indicated by the failure
of asphyxial femoral blood to cause inhibition,
while vena-cava blood, taken almost simultaneously,
brought about immediate relaxation of the
muscle. The conclusion was drawn, therefore,
that asphyxia results in increased secretion of the
adrenal glands.</p>

<p>This conclusion has been supported by Borberg
and <span class="nowrap">Fridericia,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span> and also by <span class="nowrap">Starkenstein,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
who found that an increase of carbon-dioxide in
the blood lessens the adrenin in the adrenal medulla.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span>
And recently <span class="nowrap">Czubalski<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span> also has inferred,
from the rise of blood pressure in asphyxia when
the adrenals are intact and the absence of the rise
if the adrenals are removed, that asphyxia sets
free adrenin in the blood.</p>

<p>Asphyxia, like pain and excitement, not only liberates
adrenin, but, as might be inferred from that
fact, also mobilizes <span class="nowrap">sugar.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> And, furthermore,
<span class="nowrap">Starkenstein<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> has shown that the asphyxia due
to carbon-monoxide poisoning is not accompanied
by increased blood sugar if the adrenal glands have
been removed.</p>

<p>In case strong emotions are followed by vigorous
exertions, therefore, asphyxia is likely to
result, and this will act in conjunction with the
emotional excitement and pain, or perhaps in continuation
of the influences of these states, to bring
forth still more adrenal discharge and still further
output of sugar from the liver. And these in turn
would serve the laboring muscles in the manner
already described. This suggestion is in accord
with Macleod’<span class="nowrap">s<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span> that the increased freeing of
glycogen from the liver produced by muscular exercise
is possibly associated with increased carbon-dioxide
in the blood. And it also harmonizes with
Zuntz’s <span class="nowrap">statement<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span> that the asphyxia of great
physical exertion may call out sugar to such a degree
that, in spite of the increased use of it in the
active muscles, glycosuria may ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span></p>

<p>The evidence previously adduced that adrenin
causes relaxation of the smooth muscle of the
bronchioles, taken in conjunction with the evidence
that adrenal secretion is liberated in asphyxia, suggests
that relief from difficult breathing may thus
be automatically provided for in the organism.
The well-known phenomenon of “second wind” is
characterized by an almost miraculous refreshment
and renewal of vigor, after an individual has persisted
in violent exertion in spite of being “out of
breath.” It seems not improbable that this phenomenon,
for which many explanations have been
offered, is really due to setting in operation the
supporting mechanism which, as we have seen,
plays so important a rôle in augmenting bodily
vigor in emotional excitement. The release of
sugar and adrenin, the abundance of blood flow
through the muscles&mdash;supplying energy and lessening
fatigue&mdash;and the relaxation of the bronchiolar
walls, are all occurrences which may reasonably
be regarded as resulting from asphyxia. And
when they take place they doubtless do much to
abolish the distress itself by which they were occasioned.
According to this explanation “second
wind” would consist in the establishment of the
same group of bodily changes, leading to more
efficient physical struggle, that are observed in
pain and excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Utility of Rapid Coagulation in Preventing
Loss of Blood</span></h3>

<p>The increase of blood sugar, the secretion of
adrenin, and the altered circulation in pain and
emotional excitement have been interpreted in the
foregoing discussion as biological adaptations to
conditions in wild life which are likely to involve
pain and emotional excitement, <span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, the necessities
of fighting or flight. The more rapid clotting of
blood under these same circumstances may also be
regarded as an adaptive process, useful to the organism.
The importance of conserving the blood,
especially in the struggles of mortal combat, needs
no argument. The effect of local injury in favoring
the formation of a clot to seal the opened vessels
is obviously adaptive in protecting the organism
against hemorrhage. The injury that causes
opening of blood vessels, however, is, if extensive,
likely also to produce pain. And, as already
shown, conditions producing pain increase adrenal
secretion and hasten coagulation. Thus injury
would be made less dangerous as an occasion for
serious hemorrhage by two effects which the injury
itself produces in the body&mdash;the local effect
on clotting at the region of injury and the general
effect on the speed of clotting wrought by reflex
secretion of adrenin.</p>

<p>According to the argument here presented the
strong emotions, as fear and anger, are rightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span>
interpreted as the concomitants of bodily changes
which may be of utmost service in subsequent action.
These bodily changes are so much like those
which occur in pain and fierce struggle that, as
early writers on evolution suggested, the emotions
may be considered as foreshadowing the suffering
and intensity of actual strife. On this general
basis, therefore, the bodily alterations attending
violent emotional states would, as organic preparations
for fighting and possible injury, naturally
involve the effects which pain itself would produce.
And increased blood sugar, increased
adrenin, an adapted circulation and rapid clotting
would all be favorable to the preservation of the
organism that could best produce them.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE ENERGIZING INFLUENCE OF EMOTIONAL
EXCITEMENT</p>


<p class="sp2">The close relation between emotion and muscular
action has long been perceived. As <span class="nowrap">Sherrington<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
has pointed out, “Emotion ‘moves’ us,
hence the word itself. If developed in intensity, it
impels toward vigorous movement. Every vigorous
movement of the body ... involves also
the less noticeable coöperation of the viscera, especially
of the circulatory and respiratory. The
extra demand made upon the muscles that move
the frame involves a heightened action of the
nutrient organs which supply to the muscles the
material for their energy.” The researches here
reported have revealed a number of unsuspected
ways in which muscular action is made more efficient
because of emotional disturbances of the
viscera. Every one of the visceral changes that
have been noted&mdash;the cessation of processes in the
alimentary canal (thus freeing the energy supply
for other parts); the shifting of blood from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span>
abdominal organs, whose activities are deferable,
to the organs immediately essential to muscular
exertion (the lungs, the heart, the central nervous
system); the increased vigor of contraction of the
heart; the quick abolition of the effects of muscular
fatigue; the mobilizing of energy-giving sugar
in the circulation&mdash;every one of these visceral
changes is <em>directly serviceable in making the organism
more effective in the violent display of
energy which fear or rage or pain may involve</em>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Reservoirs of Power”</span></h3>

<p>That the major emotions have an energizing
effect has been commonly <span class="nowrap">recognized.<a id="SNanchor_17" href="#Starnote_17" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Darwin
testified to having heard, “as a proof of the
exciting nature of anger, that a man when excessively
jaded will sometimes invent imaginary
offences and put himself into a passion, unconsciously
for the sake of reinvigorating himself;
and,” <span class="nowrap">Darwin<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> continues, “since hearing
this remark, I have occasionally recognized its full
truth.” Under the impulse of fear also, men have
been known to achieve extraordinary feats of
running and leaping. <span class="nowrap">McDougall<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> cites the instance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span>
of an athlete who, when pursued as a boy
by a savage animal, leaped over a wall which he
could not again “clear” until he attained his full
stature and strength. The very unusual abilities,
both physical and mental, which men have exhibited
in times of stress were dealt with from the
psychological point of view by William <span class="nowrap">James<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
in one of his last essays. He suggested that in
every person there are “reservoirs of power”
which are not ordinarily called upon, but which
are nevertheless ready to pour forth streams of
energy if only the occasion presents itself. These
figurative expressions of the psychologist receive
definite and concrete exemplification, so far as the
physical exhibitions of power are concerned, in
the highly serviceable bodily changes which have
been described in the foregoing chapters.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_17" href="#SNanchor_17" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Russell (The Pima Indians, United States Bureau of
Ethnology, 1908, p. 243) relates a tale told by the Indians to
their children, in which an injured coyote was chasing some
quails. “Finally the quails got tired,” according to the
story, “but the coyote did not, for he was angry and did not
feel fatigue.”</p>
</div>

<p>It would doubtless be incorrect to attempt to
account for all the increased strength and tireless
endurance, which may be experienced in periods
of great excitement, on the basis of abundant supplies
provided then for muscular contraction, and
a special secretion for avoiding or abolishing the
depressive influences of fatigue. Tremors, muscular
twitchings, the assumption of characteristic
attitudes, all indicate that there is an immensely
augmented activity of the nervous system&mdash;an activity
that discharges powerfully even into parts
not directly concerned in struggle, as, for example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>
into the muscles of voice, causing peculiar
cries or warning notes; into the muscles of the
ears, drawing them back or causing them to stand
erect, and into the small muscles about the lips,
tightening them and revealing the teeth. The
typical appearances of human beings, as well as
lower animals, when in the grip of such deeply
agitating emotions as fear and rage, are so well
recognized as to constitute a primitive and common
means of judging the nature of the experience
through which the organism is passing. This “pattern”
response of the nervous system to an emotion-provoking
object or situation is probably
capable of bringing into action a much greater
number of neurones in the central nervous system
than are likely to be concerned in even a supreme
act of volition. The nervous impulses delivered to
the muscles, furthermore, operate upon organs
well supplied with energy-yielding material and
well fortified by rapidly circulating blood and by
secreted adrenin, against quick loss of power because
of accumulating waste. Under such circumstances
of excitement the performance of extraordinary
feats of strength or endurance is natural
<span class="nowrap">enough.<a id="SNanchor_18" href="#Starnote_18" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote"> <p><a id="Starnote_18" href="#SNanchor_18" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  If individual neurones obey the law of either supreme action
or inaction, the “all-or-none law,” the only means of
securing a graded response is through variation of the <em>number</em>
of neurones engaged in action&mdash;the more, the greater the resulting
manifestation of strength.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span></p>

<p>In connection with the conception that strong
emotion has a dynamogenic value, it is of interest
to note that on occasions when great demands are
likely to be placed on the neuro-muscular system in
the doing of unusual labors, emotional excitement
is not uncommonly an accompaniment. In order
to emphasize points in the argument developed
thus far, I propose to cite some examples of the
association of emotional excitement with remarkable
exhibitions of power or resistance to fatigue.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Excitements and Energies of Competitive Sports</span></h3>

<p>Already in an earlier account (see <a href=#Page_75>p. 75</a>) I have
mentioned finding sugar in the urine in approximately
fifty per cent of a group of college football
players after the most exacting game of the season’s
play. As is well understood, such games are
heralded far and wide, loyal supporters of each
college may travel hundreds of miles to attend the
contest, enthusiastic meetings of undergraduate
students are held in each college to demonstrate
their devotion to the team and their confidence in
its prowess&mdash;indeed, the arguments for victory,
the songs, the cheering, are likely to be so disturbing
to the players, that before an important contest
they are not infrequently removed from
college surroundings in order to avoid being overwrought
when the contest comes.</p>

<p>On the day of the contest the excitement is multiplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
manyfold. There is practically a holiday
in college and to a large extent in the city as well.
The streets are filled with eager supporters of
each team as the hosts begin to gather at the field.
As many as 70,000 spectators may be present, each
one tense and strongly partisan. The student
bands lead the singing, by thousands of voices,
of songs which urge to the utmost effort for the
college; and, in anticipation, these songs also celebrate
the victory.</p>

<p>Into the midst of that huge, cheering, yelling,
singing, flag-waving crowd, the players are welcomed
in a special outburst of these same demonstrations
of enthusiasm. Soon the game begins.
The position of every player is known, if not because
of previous acquaintance and recognition,
because card-diagrams give the information.
Every important play is seen by the assembled
thousands, and the player who makes it is at once
announced to all, and is likely to be honored by his
multitudinous college mates in a special cheer,
ending in his name. Any player who, by infraction
of the rules or failure to do his part, loses
ground gained by his team is also known. The man
who is “played out” in efforts to win for his team
and college, and consequently has to leave the field,
is welcomed to the side lines by acclamations
suited for a great hero. In short, every effort is
made, through the powerful incentives of censure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>
and a flaunting recognition, to make each member
of the team realize vividly his responsibility, both
personal and as one of a group, for the supreme,
all-important result&mdash;victory for his college.</p>

<p>This responsibility works tremendously on the
emotions of the players. In the dressing room
before a critical contest I have seen a “gridiron
warrior,” ready in canvas suit, cleated shoes, and
leather helmet, sitting grimly on a bench, his fists
clenched, his jaws tight, and his face the color of
clay. He performed wonderfully when the game
began, and after it was over there was a large percentage
of sugar in his urine! Probably no sport
requires a more sustained and extreme display of
neuro-muscular effort than American football.
And from the foregoing description of the conditions
that surround the contests it is easy to realize
that they conspire to arouse in the players excitements
which would bring forth very efficiently
the bodily reserves for use in the fierce struggle
which the game requires.</p>

<p>What is true of football is true, though perhaps
to a less degree, of the racing sports, as running
and rowing. Again great multitudes attend the
events, the contests are followed closely from beginning
to end, and as the goal is approached the
cheering and cries for victory gather in volume
and intensity as if arranged for a thrilling climax.
The whole setting is most highly favorable to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span>
dramatic development of an acme of excitement
as the moment for the last desperate effort to win
is put forth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frenzy and Endurance in Ceremonial and Other Dances</span></h3>

<p>Dancing, which formed a significant feature of
primitive rituals, has always been accompanied by
exciting conditions, and not unusually was an exhibition
of remarkable endurance. In the transfer
of the Ark to Zion there were processions and
sacrifices, and King David “danced before the
Lord with all his might.” <span class="nowrap">Mooney<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> in his account
of dances among the American Indians tells
of a young man who in one of the ceremonials
danced three days and nights without food, drink
or sleep. In such a terrible ordeal the favoring
presence of others, who through group action help
to stimulate both the excitement and the activities,
must be an important element in prolonging the
efforts of the individual.</p>

<p>In the history of religious <span class="nowrap">manias<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> there are
many instances of large numbers of people becoming
frenzied and then showing extraordinary endurance
while dancing. In 1374 a mania broke
forth in Germany, the Netherlands and France, in
which the victims claimed to dance in honor of
Saint John. Men and women went about dancing
hand in hand, in pairs, or in a circle, on the streets,
in the churches, at their homes, or wherever they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span>
might be, hour after hour without rest. While
dancing they sang, uttered cries, and saw visions.
Whole companies of these crazy fanatics went
dancing along the public roads and into the cities,
until they had to be interfered with.</p>

<p>In 1740 an extraordinary sect, known as the
“Jumpers,” arose in Wales. According to the
description given by Wesley, their exercises were
not unlike those of certain frenzied states among
the Indians. “After the preaching was over,”
<span class="nowrap">Wesley<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> wrote, “anyone who pleased gave out
a verse of a hymn; and this they sung over and
over again, with all their might and main, thirty
or forty times, till some of them worked themselves
into a sort of drunkenness or madness; they
were then violently agitated, and leaped up and
down in all manner of postures, frequently for
hours together.” There were sometimes thousands
at a single meeting of the Jumpers, shouting
out their excitement and ready to leap for <span class="nowrap">joy.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
Wesley has also described instances of tremendous
emotional outburst at Methodist meetings which
he addressed. “Some were torn with a kind of
convulsive motion in every part of their bodies,
and that so violently that often four or five persons
could not hold one of them. I have seen
many hysterical or epileptic fits,” he wrote, “but
none of them were like these in many respects.”</p>

<p>Among the <span class="nowrap">dervishes<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> likewise the dance is accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>
by intense excitement and apparently
tireless movements. “The cries of ‘Yâ Allah!’ are
increased doubly, as also those of ‘Yâ Hoo!’ with
frightful howlings shrieked by the dervishes together
in the dance.”... “There was no regularity
in their dancing, but each seemed to be performing
the antics of a madman; now moving his
body up and down; the next moment turning
round, then using odd gesticulations with his arms,
next jumping, and sometimes screaming.”...
“At the moment when they would seem to stop
from sheer exhaustion the sheikh makes a point
of exciting them to new efforts by walking through
their midst, making also himself most violent
movements. He is next replaced by two elders,
who double the quickness of the step and the agitation
of the body; they even straighten themselves
up from time to time, and excite the envy or emulation
of others in their astonishing efforts to continue
the dance until their strength is entirely
exhausted.” Such is the frenzy thus developed
that the performers may be subjected to severe
pain, yet only show signs of elation.</p>

<p>In all these dances the two most marked features
are the intense excitement of those who engage in
them and the very remarkable physical endurance
which they manifest. Although there is no direct
evidence, such as was obtained in examining the
football players, that bodily changes favorable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>
great neuro-muscular exertion are developed in
these furies of fanaticism, it is highly probable
that they are so developed, and that the feats of
fortitude which are performed are to a large extent
explicable on the basis of a “tapping of the
reservoirs of power” through the emotional excitement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Fierce Emotions and Struggles of Battle</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the discussion of the probable significance
of the bodily changes in pain and great
emotion, the value of these changes in the struggles
of conflict or escape was emphasized. In human
beings as well as in lower animals the wildest
passions are aroused when the necessities of combat
become urgent. One needs only to glance at
the history of warfare to observe that when the
primitive emotions of anger and hatred are permitted
full sway, men who have been considerate
and thoughtful of their fellows and their fellows’
rights suddenly may turn into infuriated savages,
slaughtering innocent women and children, mutilating
the wounded, burning, ravaging, and looting,
with all the wild fervor of demons. It is in such
excesses of emotional turbulence that the most
astonishing instances of prolonged exertion and
incredible endurance are to be found.</p>

<p>Probably the fiercest struggles between men
that are recorded are those which occurred when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>
the wager of battle was a means of determining
innocence or guilt. In the corners of the plot selected
for the combat a bier was prepared for each
participant, as a symbol that the struggle was for
life or death. Each was attended by his relatives
and followers, and by his father <span class="nowrap">confessor.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
After each had prayed to God for help in the coming
combat, the weapons were selected, the sacrament
was administered, and the battle was begun.
The principals fought to the end with continuous
and brutal ferocity, resembling the desperate encounters
of wild beasts. A fairly illustrative example
is furnished in an incident which followed
the assassination of Charles the Good of Flanders
in 1127. One of the accomplices, a knight named
Guy, was challenged for complicity by another
named Herman. Both were renowned warriors.
Herman was speedily unhorsed by Guy, who with
his lance frustrated all Herman’s attempts to remount.
Then Herman disabled Guy’s horse, and
the combat was renewed on foot with swords.
Equally skilful in fence, they continued the struggle
till fatigue compelled them to drop sword and
shield, whereupon they wrestled for the mastery.
Guy threw his antagonist, fell on him, and beat
him in the face with his gauntlets till he seemed to
be motionless; but Herman had quietly slipped his
hand below the other’s coat of mail and, grasping
the testicles, with a mighty effort wrenched them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span>
away. Immediately Guy fell over and <span class="nowrap">expired.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
In such terrific fights as these, conducted in the
extremes of rage and hate, the mechanisms for
reënforcing the parts of the body which are of
primary importance in the struggle are brought
fully into action and are of utmost value in securing
victory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Stimulating Influence of Witnesses and of Music</span></h3>

<p>It is noteworthy that in all the instances thus
far cited&mdash;in the great games, in dancing, and in
fighting&mdash;two factors are present that are well
known to have an augmenting effect both in the
full development of emotions and in the performance
of unusual muscular labors. One of these is
the crowd of witnesses or participants, who contribute
the “mob spirit” that tends to carry the
actions of the individual far beyond the limits set
by any personal considerations or prudencies.
The other is the influence of music. As Darwin
long ago indicated, music has a wonderful power
of recalling in a vague and indefinite manner
strong emotions which have been felt by our ancestors
in long-past ages. Especially is this true
of martial music. For the grim purposes of war
the reed and the lute are grotesquely ill-suited; to
rouse men to action strident brass and the jarring
instruments of percussion are used in full force.
The influence of martial music on some persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span>
is so profound as to cause the muscles to tremble
and tears to come to the eyes&mdash;both indications of
the deep stirring of emotional responses in the
body. And when deeds of fortitude and fierce exertion
are to be performed the effectiveness of
such music in rousing the aggressive emotions has
long been recognized. The Romans charged their
foes amid the blasts of trumpets and horns. The
ancient Germans rushed to battle, their forces
spurred by the sounds of drums, flutes, cymbals
and clarions. There is a tradition that the Hungarian
troops are the worst in Europe, until their
bands begin to play&mdash;then they are the best! The
late General Linevitch is quoted as saying: “Music
is one of the most vital ammunitions of the Russian
army. Without music a Russian soldier would be
dull, cowardly, brutal and inefficient. From music
he absorbs a magic power of endurance, and forgets
the sufferings and mortality. It is a divine
dynamite.” And Napoleon is said to have testified
that the weird and barbaric tunes of the Cossack
regiments infuriated them to such rage that they
wiped out the cream of his <span class="nowrap">army.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> A careful
consideration of the use of martial music in warfare
would perhaps bring further interesting evidence
that its function is to reënforce the bodily
changes that attend the belligerent emotions.</p>

<p>Only a few instances of the combination of extreme
pain, rage, terror or excitement, and tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span>
muscular power have been given in the
preceding pages. Doubtless in numerous other
conditions these two groups of phenomena occur
together. In the lives of firemen and the police, in
the experiences of escaping prisoners, of shipwrecked
sailors, in the struggles between pioneers
and their savage enemies, in accounts of forced
marches or retreats, search would reveal many examples
of such bodily disturbances as have been
described in earlier chapters as augmenting the
effectiveness of muscular efforts, and such exhibitions
of power or endurance as are evidently far
beyond the ordinary. There is every reason for
believing that, were the conditions favorable to experimental
testing, it would be possible to demonstrate
and perhaps to measure the addition to the
dynamics of bodily action that appears as the accompaniment
of violent emotional disturbance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Feeling of Power</span></h3>

<p>In this connection it is highly significant that in
times of strong excitement there is not infrequent
testimony to a sense of overwhelming power that
sweeps in like a sudden tide and lifts the person
to a new high level of ability. A friend of mine,
whose nature is somewhat choleric, has told me
that when he is seized with anger, he is also possessed
by an intense conviction that he could crush
and utterly destroy the object of his hostility. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span>
I have heard a football player confess that just
before the final game such an access of strength
seemed to come to him that he felt able, on the
signal, to crouch and with a jump go crashing
through any ordinary door. There is intense satisfaction
in these moments of supreme elation,
when the body is at its acme of accomplishment.
And it is altogether probable that the critical dangers
of adventure have a fascination because fear
is thrilling, and extrication from a predicament, by
calling forth all the bodily resources and setting
them to meet the challenge of the difficulty, yields
many of the joys of conquest. For these reasons
vigorous men go forth to seek dangers and to run
large chances of serious injury. “Danger makes
us more alive. We so love to strive that we come
to love the fear that gives us strength for conflict.
Fear is not only something to be escaped from to
a place or state of safety, but welcomed as an arsenal
of augmented <span class="nowrap">strength.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> And thus in
the hazardous sports, in mountain climbing, in the
hunting of big game, and in the tremendous adventure
of war, risks and excitement and the sense
of power surge up together, setting free unsuspected
energies, and bringing vividly to consciousness
memorable fresh revelations of the possibilities
of achievement.</p>

<p class="center">THE NATURE OF HUNGER</p>


<p class="sp2">On the same plane with pain and the dominant
emotions of fear and anger, as agencies which determine
the action of organisms, is the sensation
of hunger. It is a sensation so peremptory, so disagreeable,
so tormenting, that men have committed
crimes in order to assuage it. It has led to
cannibalism, even among the civilized. It has resulted
in suicide. And it has defeated armies&mdash;for
the aggressive spirit becomes detached from
larger loyalties and turns personal and selfish as
hunger pangs increase in vigor and insistence.</p>

<p>In 1905, while observing in myself the rhythmic
sounds produced by the activities of the alimentary
tract, I had occasion to note that the sensation
of hunger was not constant but recurrent, and that
the moment of its disappearance was often associated
with a rather loud gurgling sound as heard
through the stethoscope. This and other evidence,
indicative of a source of the hunger sensations in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span>
the contractions of the digestive canal, I reported
in <span class="nowrap">1911.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> That same year, with the help of one
of my students, A.&nbsp;L. Washburn, I obtained final
proof for this inference.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Appetite and Hunger</span></h3>

<p>The sensations of appetite and hunger are so
complex and so intimately interrelated that any
discussion of either sensation is sure to go astray
unless at the start there is clear understanding of
the meanings of the terms. The view has been
propounded that appetite is the first degree of
hunger, the mild and pleasant stage, agreeable in
character; and that hunger itself is a more advanced
condition, disagreeable and even painful&mdash;the
unpleasant result of not satisfying the <span class="nowrap">appetite.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
On this basis appetite and hunger would
differ only quantitatively. Another view, which
seems more justifiable, is that the two experiences
are fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Careful observation indicates that appetite is related
to previous sensations of taste and smell of
food. Delightful or disgusting tastes and odors,
associated with this or that edible substance, determine
the appetite. It has, therefore, important
psychic elements in its composition. Thus, by taking
thought, we can anticipate the odor of a delicious
beefsteak or the taste of peaches and cream,
and in that imagination we can find pleasure. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span>
the realization, direct effects in the senses of taste
and smell give still further delight. As already
noted in the first chapter, observations on experimental
animals and on human beings have shown
that the pleasures of both anticipation and realization,
by stimulating the flow of saliva and gastric
juice, play a highly significant rôle in the initiation
of digestive processes.</p>

<p>Among prosperous people, supplied with abundance
of food, the appetite seems sufficient to ensure
for bodily needs a proper supply of nutriment.
We eat because dinner is announced, because
by eating we avoid unpleasant consequences,
and because food is placed before us in delectable
form and with tempting tastes and odors. Under
less easy circumstances, however, the body needs
are supplied through the much stronger and more
insistent demands of hunger.</p>

<p>The sensation of hunger is difficult to describe,
but almost everyone from childhood has felt at
times that dull ache or gnawing pain referred to
the lower mid-chest region and the epigastrium,
which may take imperious control of human actions.
As Sternberg has pointed out, hunger may
be sufficiently insistent to force the taking of food
which is so distasteful that it not only fails to
rouse appetite, but may even produce nausea. The
hungry being gulps his food with a rush. The
pleasures of appetite are not for him&mdash;he wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>
quantity rather than quality, and he wants it at
once.</p>

<p>Hunger and appetite are, therefore, widely different&mdash;in
physiological basis, in localization and
in psychic elements. Hunger may be satisfied
while the appetite still calls. Who is still hungry
when the tempting dessert is served, and yet are
there any who refuse it, on the plea that they no
longer need it? On the other hand, appetite may
be in abeyance while hunger is <span class="nowrap">goading.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> What
ravenous boy is critical of his food? Do we not
all know that “hunger is the best sauce”? Although
the two sensations may thus exist separately, they
nevertheless have the same function of leading to
the intake of food, and they usually appear together.
Indeed, the coöperation of hunger and appetite
is probably the reason for their being so
frequently confused.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Sensation of Hunger</span></h3>

<p>Hunger may be described as having a central
core and certain more or less variable accessories.
The peculiar dull ache of hungriness, referred to
the epigastrium, is usually the organism’s first
strong demand for food; and when the initial order
is not obeyed, the sensation is likely to grow
into a highly uncomfortable pang or gnawing, less
definitely localized as it becomes more intense.
This may be regarded as the essential feature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>
hunger. Besides the dull ache, however, lassitude
and drowsiness may appear, or faintness, or violent
headache, or irritability and restlessness such
that continuous effort in ordinary affairs becomes
increasingly difficult. That these states differ
much with individuals&mdash;headache in one and faintness
in another, for example&mdash;indicates that they
do not constitute the central fact of hunger, but
are more or less inconstant accompaniments. The
“feeling of emptiness,” which has been mentioned
as an important element of the <span class="nowrap">experience,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> is
an inference rather than a distinct datum of consciousness,
and can likewise be eliminated from
further consideration. The dull pressing sensation
is left, therefore, as the constant characteristic,
the central fact, to be examined in detail.</p>

<p>Hunger can evidently be regarded from the
psychological point of view, and discussed solely
on the basis of introspection; or it can be studied
with reference to its antecedents and to the physiological
conditions which accompany it&mdash;a consideration
which requires the use of both objective
methods and subjective observation. This psycho-physiological
treatment of the subject will be deferred
till the last. Certain theories which have
been advanced with regard to hunger, and which
have been given more or less credit, must first be
examined.</p>

<p>Two main theories have been advocated. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>
first is supported by contentions that hunger is a
general sensation, arising at no special region of
the body, but having a local reference. This theory
has been more widely credited by physiologists
and psychologists than the other. The other is
supported by evidence that hunger has a local
source and therefore a local reference. In the
course of our examination of these views we shall
have opportunity to consider some pertinent new
observations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Theory That Hunger is a General Sensation</span></h3>

<p>The conception that hunger arises from a general
condition of the body rests in turn on the notion
that, as the body uses up material, the blood
becomes impoverished. <span class="nowrap">Schiff<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> advocated this
notion, and suggested that poverty of the blood in
food substance affects the tissues in such manner
that they demand a new supply. The nerve cells
of the brain share in this general shortage of provisions,
and because of internal changes, give rise
to the sensation. Thus is hunger explained as an
experience dependent on the body as a whole.</p>

<p>Three classes of evidence are cited in support
of this view:</p>

<p>1. “Hunger increases as time passes”&mdash;a partial
statement. The development of hunger as time
passes is a common observation which quite accords
with the assumption that the condition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>
body and the state of the blood are becoming constantly
worse, so long as the need, once established,
is not satisfied.</p>

<p>While it is true that with the lapse of time hunger
increases as the supply of body nutriment decreases,
this concomitance is not proof that the
sensation arises directly from a serious encroachment
on the store of food materials. If this argument
were valid we should expect hunger to become
more and more distressing until death follows
from starvation. There is abundant evidence that
the sensation is not thus intensified; on the contrary,
during continued fasting hunger, at least in
some persons, wholly disappears after the first few
days. <span class="nowrap">Luciani,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> who carefully recorded the experience
of the faster Succi, states that after a certain
time the hunger feelings vanish and do not
return. And he tells of two dogs that showed no
signs of hunger after the third or fourth day of
fasting; thereafter they remained quite passive
in the presence of food. <span class="nowrap">Tigerstedt,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> who also has
studied the metabolism of starvation, declares that
although the desire to eat is very great during the
first day of the ordeal, the unpleasant sensations
disappear early, and that at the end of the fast the
subject may have to force himself to take nourishment.
The subject, <span class="nowrap">“J. A.,”</span> studied by Tigerstedt
and his co-workers,<span class="nowrap"><a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> reported that after the fourth
day of fasting, he had no disagreeable feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span></p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Carrington,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> after examining many persons
who, to better their health, abstained from eating
for different periods, records that “habit-hunger”
usually lasts only two or three days and, if plenty
of water is drunk, does not last longer than three
days. <span class="nowrap">Viterbi,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> a Corsican lawyer condemned
to death for political causes, determined to escape
execution by depriving his body of food and drink.
During the eighteen days that he lived he kept
careful notes. On the third day the sensation of
hunger departed, and although thereafter thirst
came and went, hunger never returned. Still further
evidence of the same character could be cited,
but enough has already been given to show that
after the first few days of fasting the hunger feelings
may wholly cease. On the theory that hunger
is a manifestation of bodily need, are we to suppose
that, in the course of starvation, the body is
mysteriously not in need after the third day, and
that therefore the sensation of hunger disappears?
The absurdity of such a view is obvious.</p>

<p>2. “Hunger may be felt though the stomach be
full”&mdash;a selected alternative. Instances of duodenal
fistula in man have been carefully studied,
which have shown that a modified sensation of
hunger may be felt when the stomach is full. A
famous case described by <span class="nowrap">Busch<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> has been repeatedly
used as evidence. His patient, who lost
nutriment through a duodenal fistula, was hungry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span>
soon after eating, and felt satisfied only when the
chyme was restored to the intestine through the
distal fistulous opening. As food is absorbed
mainly through the intestinal wall, the inference
is direct that the general bodily state, and not the
local conditions of the alimentary canal, must account
for the patient’s feelings.</p>

<p>A full consideration of the evidence from cases
of duodenal fistula cannot so effectively be presented
now as later. That in Busch’s case hunger
disappeared while food was being taken is, as we
shall see, quite significant. It may be that the
restoration of chyme to the intestine quieted
hunger, not because nutriment was thus introduced
into the body, but because the presence of
material altered the nature of gastro-intestinal
activity. The basis for this suggestion will be
given in due course.</p>

<p>3. “Animals may eat eagerly after section of
their vagus and splanchnic nerves”&mdash;a fallacious
argument. The third support for the view that
hunger has a general origin in the body is derived
from observations on experimental animals. By
severance of the vagus and splanchnic nerves, the
lower esophagus, the stomach and the small intestine
can be wholly separated from the central
nervous system. Animals thus operated upon
nevertheless eat food placed before them, and may
indeed manifest some eagerness for <span class="nowrap">it.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span>
is this behavior to be accounted for&mdash;when the
possibility of local stimulation has been eliminated&mdash;save
by assuming a central origin of the impulse
to eat?</p>

<p>The fallacy of this evidence, though repeatedly
overlooked, is easily shown. We have already seen
that appetite as well as hunger may lead to the
taking of food. Indeed, the animal with all gastro-intestinal
nerves cut may have the same incentive
to eat that a well-fed man may have, who
delights in the pleasurable taste and smell of food
and knows nothing of hunger pangs. Even when
the nerves of taste are cut, as they were in
Longet’s <span class="nowrap">experiments,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> sensations of smell are
still possible, as well as agreeable associations
which can be roused by sight. More than fifty
years ago <span class="nowrap">Ludwig<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> pointed out that, even if
all the nerves were severed, psychic reasons could
be given for the taking of food, and yet because
animals eat after one or another set of nerves is
eliminated, the conclusion has been drawn by various
writers that the nerves in question are thereby
proved to be not concerned in the sensation of
hunger. Evidently, since hunger is not required
for eating, the act of eating is no testimony whatever
that the animal is hungry, and, after the
nerves have been severed, is no proof that hunger
is of central origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Weakness of the Assumptions Underlying the Theory
That Hunger is a General Sensation</span></h3>

<p>The evidence thus far examined has been shown
to afford only shaky support for the theory that
hunger is a general sensation. The theory, furthermore,
is weak in its fundamental assumptions.
There is no clear indication, for example, that the
blood undergoes or has undergone any marked
change, chemical or physical, when the first stages
of hunger appear. There is no evidence of any
direct chemical stimulation of the gray matter of
the cerebral cortex. Indeed, attempts to excite the
gray matter artificially by chemical agents have
been without <span class="nowrap">results;<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> and even electrical stimulation,
which is effective, must, in order to
produce movements, be so powerful that the movements
have been attributed to excitation of underlying
white matter rather than cells in the gray.
This insensitivity of cortical cells to direct stimulation
is not at all favorable to the notion that they
are sentinels set to warn against too great diminution
of bodily supplies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Body Need May Exist Without Hunger</span></h3>

<p>Still further evidence opposed to the theory that
hunger results directly from the using up of organic
stores is found in patients suffering from
fever. Metabolism in fever patients is augmented,
body substance is destroyed to such a degree that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>
the weight of the patient may be greatly reduced,
and yet the sensation of hunger under these conditions
of increased need is wholly lacking.</p>

<p>Again, if a person is hungry and takes food,
the sensation is suppressed soon afterwards, long
before any considerable amount of nutriment
could be digested and absorbed, and therefore
long before the blood and the general bodily condition,
if previously altered, could be restored to
normal.</p>

<p>Furthermore, persons exposed to privation have
testified that hunger can be temporarily suppressed
by swallowing indigestible materials. Certainly
scraps of leather and bits of moss, not to
mention clay eaten by the Otomacs, would not materially
compensate for large organic losses. In
rebuttal to this argument the comment has been
made that central states as a rule can be readily
overwhelmed by peripheral stimulation, and just
as sleep, for example, can be abolished by bathing
the temples, so hunger can be abolished by irritating
the gastric <span class="nowrap">walls.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> This comment is beside
the point, for it meets the issue by merely assuming
as true the condition under discussion. The
absence of hunger during the ravages of fever, and
its quick abolition after food or even indigestible
stuff is swallowed, still further weakens the argument,
therefore, that the sensation arises directly
from lack of nutriment in the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Theory That Hunger is of General Origin Does Not
Explain the Quick Onset and the Periodicity
of the Sensation</span></h3>

<p>Many persons have noted that hunger has a
sharp onset. A person may be tramping in the
woods or working in the fields, where fixed attention
is not demanded, and without premonition
may feel the abrupt arrival of the characteristic
ache. The expression “grub-struck” is a picturesque
description of this experience. If this
sudden arrival of the sensation corresponds to the
general bodily state, the change in the general bodily
state must occur with like suddenness or have
a critical point at which the sensation is instantly
precipitated. There is no evidence whatever that
either of these conditions occurs in the course of
metabolism.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of hunger, which I have already
mentioned, is its intermittency. It may
come and go several times in the course of a few
hours. Furthermore, while the sensation is prevailing,
its intensity is not uniform, but marked
by ups and downs. In some instances the ups and
downs change to a periodic presence and absence
without change of rate. In my own experience the
hunger pangs came and went on one occasion as
follows:</p>

<table class="pangs">

<tr>
<th>Came</th>
<th>Went</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1">12&mdash;37&mdash;20</td>
<td class="col2">38&mdash;30</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>40&mdash;45</td>
<td class="col2">41&mdash;10</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1">41&mdash;45</td>
<td class="col2">42&mdash;25</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1">43&mdash;20</td>
<td class="col2">43&mdash;35</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1">44&mdash;40</td>
<td class="col2">45&mdash;55</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="col1">46&mdash;15</td>
<td class="col2">46&mdash;30</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on, for ten minutes longer. Again in this
relation, the intermittent and periodic character
of hunger would require, on the theory under examination,
that the bodily supplies be intermittently
and periodically insufficient. During one moment
the absence of hunger would imply an
abundance of nutriment in the organism, ten seconds
later the presence of hunger would imply
that the stores had been suddenly reduced, ten
seconds later still the absence of hunger would
imply a sudden renewal of plenty. Such zig-zag
shifts of the general bodily state may not be impossible,
but from all that is known of the course
of metabolism, such quick changes are highly improbable.
The periodicity of hunger, therefore, is
further evidence against the theory that the sensation
has a general basis in the body.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Theory That Hunger is of General Origin Does Not
Explain the Local Reference</span></h3>

<p>The last objection to this theory is that it does
not account for the most common feature of
hunger&mdash;namely, the reference of the sensation to
the region of the stomach. Schiff and <span class="nowrap">others<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
who have supported the theory have met this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
objection by two contentions. First they have
pointed out that the sensation is not always referred
to the stomach. Schiff interrogated ignorant
soldiers regarding the local reference; several
indicated the neck or chest, twenty-three the
sternum, four were uncertain of any region, and
two only designated the stomach. In other words,
the stomach region was most rarely mentioned.</p>

<p>The second contention against the importance
of local reference is that such evidence is fallacious.
An armless man may feel tinglings which
seem to arise in fingers which have long since
ceased to be a portion of his body. The fact that
he experiences such tinglings and ascribes them to
dissevered parts, does not prove that the sensation
originates in those parts. And similarly the
assignment of the ache of hunger to any special
region of the body does not demonstrate that the
ache arises from that region. Such are the arguments
against a local origin of hunger.</p>

<p>Concerning these arguments we may recall, first,
Schiff’s admission that the soldiers he questioned
were too few to give conclusive evidence. Further,
the testimony of most of them that hunger seemed
to originate in the chest or region of the sternum
cannot be claimed as unfavorable to a peripheral
source of the sensation. The description of feelings
which develop from disturbances within the
body is almost always indefinite. As Head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span><a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and others have shown, conditions in a viscus
which give rise to sensation are likely not to be attributed
to the viscus, but to related skin areas.
Under such circumstances we do not dismiss
the testimony as worthless merely because it
may not point precisely to the source of the
trouble. On the contrary, we use such testimony
constantly as a basis for judging internal disorders.</p>

<p>With regard to the contention that reference to
the periphery is not proof of the peripheral origin
of a sensation, we may answer that the force of
that contention depends on the amount of accessory
evidence which is available. Thus if we see
an object come into contact with a finger, we are
justified in assuming that the simultaneous sensation
of touch which we refer to that finger has resulted
from the contact, and is not a purely central
experience accidentally attributed to an outlying
member. Similarly in the case of hunger&mdash;all that
we need as support for the peripheral reference of
the sensation is proof that conditions occur there,
simultaneously with hunger pangs, which might
reasonably be regarded as giving rise to those
pangs.</p>

<p>With the requirement in mind that peripheral
conditions be adequate, let us examine the state
of the fasting stomach to see whether, indeed, conditions
may be present in times of hunger which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span>
would sustain the theory that hunger has a local
outlying source.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hunger Not Due To Emptiness of the Stomach</span></h3>

<p>Among the suggestions which have been offered
to account for a peripheral origin of the sensation
is that of attributing it to emptiness of the stomach.
By use of the stomach tube <span class="nowrap">Nicolai<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span> found
that when his subjects had their first intimation
of hunger the stomach was quite empty.
But, in other instances, after lavage of the stomach,
the sensation did not appear for intervals varying
between one and a half and three and a half
hours. During these intervals the stomach must
have been empty, and yet no sensation was experienced.
The same testimony was given long before
by <span class="nowrap">Beaumont,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> who, from his observations on
Alexis St. Martin, declared that hunger arises some
time after the stomach is normally evacuated.
Mere emptiness of the organ, therefore, does not
explain the phenomenon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hunger Not Due to Hydrochloric Acid in the Empty
Stomach</span></h3>

<p>A second theory, apparently suggested by observations
on cases of hyperacidity, is that the ache or
pang is due to the natural hydrochloric acid of the
stomach but secreted while the organ is empty.
Again the facts are hostile. <span class="nowrap">Nicolai<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span> reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>
that the gastric wash-water from his hungry subjects
was neutral or only slightly acid. This
testimony confirms Beaumont’s statement, and
is in complete agreement with the results of
gastric examination of fasting animals reported
by numerous experimenters. There is no secretion
into the empty stomach during the first days
of starvation. Furthermore, persons suffering
from absence of hydrochloric acid (achylia gastrica)
declare that they have normal feelings of
hunger. Hydrochloric acid cannot, therefore, be
called upon to account for the sensation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hunger Not Due to Turgescence of the Gastric Mucous
Membrane</span></h3>

<p>Another theory, which was first advanced by
<span class="nowrap">Beaumont,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> is that hunger arises from turgescence
of the gastric glands. The disappearance of
the pangs as fasting continues has been accounted
for by supposing that the gastric glands share in
the general depletion of the body, and that thus the
turgescence is <span class="nowrap">relieved.<a id="SNanchor_19" href="#Starnote_19" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> This turgescence theory
has commended itself to several recent writers.
Thus <span class="nowrap">Luciani<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span> has accepted it, and by adding
the idea that nerves distributed to the mucosa are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span>
specially sensitive to deprivation of food he accounts
for the hunger pangs. Also <span class="nowrap">Valenti<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
declared a few years ago that the turgescence
theory of Beaumont is the only one with a semblance
of truth in it. The experimental work reported
by these two investigators, however, does
not necessarily sustain the turgescence theory.
Luciani severed the previously exposed vagi after
cocainizing them, and Valenti merely cocainized
the nerves; the fasting dogs, eager to eat a few
minutes previous to this operation, now ran about
as before, but when offered food, licked and smelled
it, but did not take it. This total neglect of the
food lasted varying periods up to two hours. The
vagus nerves seem, indeed, to convey impulses
which affect the procedure of eating, but there is
no clear evidence that those impulses arise from
distention of the gland cells. The turgescence
theory, moreover, does not explain the effect of
taking indigestible material into the stomach.
According to Pawlow, and to others who have observed
human beings, the chewing and swallowing
of unappetizing stuff does not cause any secretion
of gastric juice (see <a href=#Page_8>p. 8</a>). Yet such stuff when
swallowed will cause the disappearance of hunger,
and Nicolai found that the sensation could be abolished
by simply introducing a stomach sound. It
is highly improbable that the turgescence of the
gastric glands can be reduced by either of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>
procedures. The turgescence theory, furthermore,
does not explain the quick onset of hunger, or its
intermittent and periodic character. That the cells
are repeatedly swollen and contracted within periods
a few seconds in duration is almost inconceivable.
For these reasons, therefore, the theory that
hunger results from turgescence of the gastric
mucosa can reasonably be rejected.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_19" href="#SNanchor_19" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  A better explanation perhaps is afforded by Boldireff’s
discovery that at the end of two or three days the stomachs
of fasting dogs begin to secrete gastric juice and continue
the secretion indefinitely. (Boldireff, Archives Biologiques
de St. Petersburg, 1905, xi, p. 98.)</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hunger the Result of Contractions</span></h3>

<p>There remain to be considered, as a possible
cause of hunger pangs, contractions of the stomach
and other parts of the alimentary canal. This suggestion
is not new. Sixty-nine years ago <span class="nowrap">Weber<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
declared his belief that “strong contraction of
the muscle fibres of the wholly empty stomach,
whereby its cavity disappears, makes a part of the
sensation which we call hunger.” <span class="nowrap">Vierordt<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span> drew
the same inference twenty-five years later (in
1871), and since then Ewald, Knapp, and Hertz
have declared their adherence to this view. These
writers have not brought forward any direct evidence
for their conclusion, though Hertz has cited
Boldireff’s observations on fasting dogs as probably
accounting for what he terms “the gastric
constituent of the sensation.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Empty Stomach and Intestine Contract</span></h3>

<p>The argument commonly used against the gastric
contraction theory is that the stomach is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span>
energetically active when empty. Thus <span class="nowrap">Schiff<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
stated, “The movements of the empty stomach
are rare and much less energetic than during digestion.”
<span class="nowrap">Luciani<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> expressed his disbelief by asserting
that gastric movements are much more active
during gastric digestion than at other times,
and cease almost entirely when the stomach has
discharged its contents. And <span class="nowrap">Valenti<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> stated
(1910), “We know very well that gastric movements
are exaggerated while digestion is proceeding
in the stomach, but when the organ is empty
they are more rare and much less pronounced,”
and, therefore, they cannot account for hunger.</p>

<p>Evidence opposed to these suppositions has been
in existence for many years. In 1899 <span class="nowrap">Bettmann<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
called attention to the contracted condition of
the stomach after several days’ fast. In 1902
<span class="nowrap">Wolff<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> reported that after forty-eight hours
without food the stomach of the cat may be so small
as to look like a slightly enlarged duodenum. In a
similar circumstance I have noticed the same extraordinary
smallness of the organ, especially in
the pyloric half. The anatomist <span class="nowrap">His<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span> also recorded
his observation of the phenomenon. In 1905
<span class="nowrap">Boldireff<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span> demonstrated that the whole gastro-intestinal
tract has a periodic activity while not digesting.
Each period of activity lasts from twenty
to thirty minutes, and is characterized in the stomach
by rhythmic contractions ten to twenty in number.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>
These contractions, Boldireff reports, may be
stronger than during digestion, and his published
records clearly support this statement. The intervals
of repose between periodic recurrences of the
contractions lasted from one and a half to two and
a half hours. Especially noteworthy is Boldireff’s
observation that if fasting is continued for two or
three days, the groups of contractions appear at
gradually longer intervals and last for gradually
shorter periods, and thereupon, as the gastric
glands begin continuous secretion, all movements
cease.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Observations Suggesting that Contractions Cause
Hunger</span></h3>

<p>The research, previously mentioned, on the
rhythmic sounds produced by the digestive process,
I was engaged in when Boldireff’s paper was
published. That contractions of the alimentary
canal on a gaseous content might explain the hunger
pangs which I had noticed seemed probable at
that time, especially in the light of Boldireff’s observations.
Indeed, <span class="nowrap">Boldireff<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span> himself had considered
hunger in relation to the activities he
described, but solely with the idea that hunger
might <em>provoke</em> them; and since the activities dwindled
in force and frequency as time passed, whereas,
in his belief, they should have become more pronounced,
he abandoned the notion of any relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span>
between the phenomena. Did not Boldireff misinterpret
his own observations? When he was considering
whether hunger might cause the contractions,
did he not overlook the possibility that the
contractions might cause hunger? A number of
experiences have led to the conviction that Boldireff
did, indeed, fail to perceive part of the significance
of his results. For example, I have noticed
the disappearance of a hunger pang as gas was
heard gurgling upward through the cardia. That
the gas was rising rather than being forced downward
was proved by its regurgitation immediately
after the sound was heard. In all probability the
pressure that forced the gas from the stomach was
the cause of the preceding sensation of hunger.
Again the sensation can be momentarily abolished
a few seconds after swallowing a small accumulation
of saliva or a teaspoonful of water. If the
stomach is in strong contraction in hunger, this result
can be accounted for, in accordance with the
observations of Lieb and <span class="nowrap">myself,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> as due to the
inhibition of the contraction by swallowing. Thus
also could be explained the prompt vanishing of
the ache soon after we begin to eat, for repeated
swallowing results in continued <span class="nowrap">inhibition.<a id="SNanchor_20" href="#Starnote_20" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Furthermore,
Ducceschi’s <span class="nowrap">discovery<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span> that hydrochloric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span>
acid diminishes the tonus of the pyloric portion
of the stomach may have its application here;
the acid would be secreted as food is taken and
would then cause relaxation of the very region
which is most strongly contracted.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_20" href="#SNanchor_20" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The absence of hunger in Busch’s patient while food was
being eaten (see <a href=#Page_239>p. 239</a>) can also be accounted for in this
manner.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Concomitance of Contractions and Hunger in Man</span></h3>

<p>Although the evidence above outlined had led
me to the conviction that hunger results from contractions
of the alimentary canal, direct proof was
still lacking. In order to learn whether such proof
might be secured, Washburn determined to become
accustomed to the presence of a rubber tube
in the <span class="nowrap">esophagus.<a id="SNanchor_21" href="#Starnote_21" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Almost every day for several
weeks Washburn introduced as far as the stomach
a small tube, to the lower end of which was attached
a soft-rubber balloon about 8 centimeters in diameter.
The tube was thus carried about each time
for two or three hours. After this preliminary
experience the introduction of the tube and its
presence in the gullet and stomach were not at all
disturbing. When a record was to be taken, the
balloon, placed just within the stomach, was moderately
distended with air, and was connected with a
water manometer ending in a cylindrical chamber
3.5 centimeters wide. A float recorder resting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span>
the water in the chamber permitted registering any
contractions of the fundus of the stomach. On the
days of observation Washburn would abstain from
breakfast, or eat sparingly; and without taking
any luncheon would appear in the laboratory about
two o’clock. The recording apparatus was arranged
as above described. In order to avoid any
error that might arise from artificial pressure on
the balloon, a pneumograph, fastened below the
ribs, was made to record the movements of the
abdominal wall. Uniformity of these movements
would show that no special contractions of the abdominal
muscles were made. Between the records
of gastric pressure and abdominal movement, time
was marked in minutes, and an electromagnetic
signal traced a line which could be altered by pressing
a key. All these recording arrangements were
out of Washburn’s sight; he sat with one hand at
the key, ready whenever the sensation of hunger
was experienced to make the current which moved
the signal.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_21" href="#SNanchor_21" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Nicolai (<i><abbr title="Work already cited">loc. cit.</abbr></i>) reported that although the introduction
of a stomach tube at first abolished hunger in his subjects,
with repeated use the effects became insignificant.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the observations were started before
any hunger was noted; at other times the sensation,
after running a course, gave way to a feeling
of fatigue. Under either of these circumstances
there were no contractions of the stomach. When
Washburn stated that he was hungry, however,
powerful contractions of the stomach were invariably
being registered. As in my own earlier experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>
the sensations were characterized by periodic
recurrences with free intervals, or by periodic
accesses of an uninterrupted ache. The record
of Washburn’s introspection of his hunger pangs
agreed closely with the record of his gastric contractions.
Almost invariably, however, the contraction
nearly reached its maximum before the
record of the sensation was started (see <a href=#Figure_37>Fig. 37</a>).</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_37">
  <img class="w80" src="images/fig37.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>
<span class="smcap">Figure 37.</span>&mdash;One-half the original size.
The top record represents intragastric pressure
(the small oscillations due to respiration,
the large to contractions of the stomach); the
second record is time in minutes (ten minutes);
the third record is W’s report of hunger
pangs; the lowest record is respiration registered
by means of a pneumograph about the
abdomen.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This fact may be regarded as evidence that the
contraction precedes the sensation, and not <i lang="la" title="the other way about">vice
versa</i>, as Boldireff considered it. The contractions
were about a half-minute in duration, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span>
the intervals between varied from thirty to ninety
seconds, with an average of about one minute. The
augmentations of intragastric pressure in Washburn
ranged between eleven and thirteen in twenty
minutes; I had previously counted in myself eleven
hunger pangs in the same time. The rate in each
of us was, therefore, approximately the same.
This rate is slightly slower than that found in
dogs by Boldireff; the difference is perhaps correlated
with the slower rhythm of gastric peristalsis
in man compared with that in the <span class="nowrap">dog.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Before hunger was experienced by Washburn
the recording apparatus revealed no signs of gastric
activity. Sometimes a rather tedious period
of waiting had to be endured before contractions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span>
occurred. And after they began they continued
for a while, then ceased (see <a href=#Figure_38>Fig. 38</a>). The feeling
of hunger, which was reported while the contractions
were recurring, disappeared as the waves
stopped. The inability of the subject to control
the contractions eliminated the possibility of their
being artifacts, perhaps induced by suggestion.
The close concomitance of the contractions with
hunger pangs, therefore, clearly indicates that they
are the real source of those pangs.</p>


<figure class="figcenter illo" id="Figure_38">

<p>Boldireff’s studies proved that when the empty
stomach is manifesting periodic contractions, the
intestines also are active. Conceivably all parts
of the alimentary canal composed of smooth muscle
share in these movements. The lower esophagus
in man is provided with smooth muscle. It
was possible to determine whether this region in
Washburn was active during hunger.</p>

<p>To the esophageal tube a thin-rubber finger-cot
(2 centimeters in length) was attached and lowered
into the stomach. The little rubber bag was distended
with air, and the tube, pinched to keep the
bag inflated, was gently withdrawn until resistance
was felt. The air was now released from the bag
and the tube farther withdrawn about 3 centimeters.
The bag was again distended with air at
a manometric pressure of 10 centimeters of water.
Inspiration now caused the writing lever, which
recorded the pressure changes, to rise; and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span>
slightly farther withdrawal of the tube changed
the rise, on inspiration, to a fall. The former position
of the tube, therefore, was above the gastric
cavity and below the diaphragm. In this position
the bag, attached to a float recorder (with chamber
2.3 centimeters in diameter), registered the periodic
oscillations shown in <a href=#Figure_39>Fig. 39</a>. Though individually
more prolonged than those of the stomach,
these contractions, it will be noted, occur at about
the same rate.</p>

The top record represents compression of

The pressure in the bag varied between 9
and 13 centimeters of water. The cylinder
of the recorder was of smaller diameter
than that used in the gastric records. The
esophageal contractions compressed the
bag so completely that, at the summits of
the large oscillations, the respirations were
not registered. When the oscillations
dropped to the time line, the bag was about
half inflated. The middle line registers
time in minutes (ten minutes). The bottom

<p>This study of hunger, reported by Washburn
and myself in 1912, has since been taken up by
Carlson of Chicago, and in observations on a man
with a permanent gastric fistula, as well as on himself
and his collaborators, he has fully confirmed
our evidence as to the relation between contractions
of the alimentary canal and the hunger sensation.
In a series of nearly a score of interesting
papers, Carlson and his <span class="nowrap">students<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span> have greatly
amplified our knowledge of the physiology of the
“empty” stomach. Not only are there the contractions
observed by Washburn and myself, but at
times these may fuse into a continuous cramp of
the gastric muscle. The characteristic contractions,
furthermore, continue after the vagus nerve
supply to the stomach has been destroyed, and,
therefore, are not dependent on the reception of
impulses by way of the cranial autonomic fibres.
Recently Luckhardt and Carlson have brought forward
evidence that the blood of a fasting animal
if injected into the vein of a normal animal is
capable of inducing in the latter the condition of
cramp or tetanus in the gastric muscle mentioned
above&mdash;an effect which does not occur when the
blood of a well-fed animal is injected. It seems
<em>possible</em> that a substance exists in the blood which
acts to excite the gastric hunger mechanism. But
this point will require further investigation.</p>

<p>With these demonstrations that contractions are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span>
the immediate cause of hunger, most of the difficulties
confronting other explanations are readily
obviated. Thus the sudden onset of hunger and
its peculiar periodicity&mdash;phenomena which no
other explanation of hunger can account for&mdash;are
at once explained.</p>

<p>In fever, when bodily material is being most
rapidly used, hunger is absent. Its absence is
understood from an observation made by <span class="nowrap">F. T.</span>
Murphy and <span class="nowrap">myself,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span> that infection, with systemic
involvement, is accompanied by a total
cessation of all movements of the alimentary canal.
Boldireff observed that when his dogs were fatigued
the rhythmic contractions failed to appear.
Being “too tired to eat” is thereby given a rational
explanation.</p>

<p>A pathological form of the sensation&mdash;the inordinate
hunger (bulimia) of certain neurotics&mdash;is
in accordance with the well-known disturbances
of the tonic innervation of the alimentary canal
in such individuals.</p>

<p>Since the lower end of the esophagus, as well
as the stomach, contracts periodically in hunger,
the reference of the sensation to the sternum by
the ignorant persons questioned by Schiff was
wholly natural. The activity of the lower esophagus
also explains why, after the stomach has been
removed, or in some cases when the stomach is
distended with food, hunger can still be experienced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>
Conceivably the intestines also originate
vague sensations by their contractions. Indeed,
the final banishment of the modified hunger sensation
in the patient with duodenal fistula, described
by Busch, may have been due to the lessened
activity of the intestines when chyme was
injected into them.</p>

<p>The observations recorded in this paper have,
as already noted, numerous points of similarity to
Boldireff’s <span class="nowrap">observations<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> on the periodic activity
of the alimentary canal in fasting dogs. Each
period of activity, he found, comprised not only
widespread contractions of the digestive canal, but
also the pouring out of bile, and of pancreatic and
intestinal juices rich in ferments. Gastric juice
was not secreted at these times; when it was secreted
and reached the intestine, the periodic activity
ceased. What is the significance of this extensive
disturbance? I have elsewhere presented <span class="nowrap">evidence<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
that gastric peristalsis is dependent on
the stretching of gastric muscle when tonically contracted.
The evidence that the stomach is in fact
strongly contracted in hunger&mdash;<span class="nowrap"><abbr title="that is">i.&#8201;e.</abbr></span>, in a state of
high tonus&mdash;has been presented <span class="nowrap">above.<a id="SNanchor_22" href="#Starnote_22" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span>
the very condition which causes hunger and leads
to the taking of food is the condition, when the
swallowed food stretches the shortened muscles,
for immediate starting of gastric peristalsis. In
this connection the observations of Haudek and
<span class="nowrap">Stigler<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span> are probably significant. They found
that the stomach discharges its contents more rapidly
if food is eaten in hunger than if not so eaten.
Hunger, in other words, is normally the signal that
the stomach is contracted for action; the unpleasantness
of hunger leads to eating; eating starts
gastric digestion, and abolishes the sensation.
Meanwhile the pancreatic and intestinal juices, as
well as bile, have been prepared in the duodenum
to receive the oncoming chyme. The periodic activity
of the alimentary canal in fasting, therefore,
is not solely the source of hunger pangs, but is at
the same time an exhibition in the digestive organs
of readiness for prompt attack on the food swallowed
by the hungry animal.</p>

<p class="center">THE INTERRELATIONS OF EMOTIONS</p>


<p class="sp2">Emotions gain expression through discharges
along the neurones of the autonomic nervous system.
The reader will recall that this system has
three divisions&mdash;the cranial and sacral, separated
by the sympathetic&mdash;and that when the neurones of
the mid-division meet in any organ the neurones of
either of the end divisions, the influence of the two
sets is antagonistic. As previously stated (<a href=#Page_35>p. 35</a>),
there is evidence that arrangements exist in the
central nervous system for reciprocal innervation
of these antagonistic divisions, just as there is
reciprocal innervation of antagonistic skeletal
muscles. The characteristic affective states manifested
in the working of these three divisions have
been described. Undoubtedly, these states have
correspondents&mdash;activities and inhibitions&mdash;in the
central neurones. The question now arises, are
the states which appear in opposed divisions also
in opposition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Antagonism Between Emotions Expressed in the Sympathetic
and in the Cranial Divisions of the Autonomic
System</span></h3>

<p>The cranial autonomic, as already shown, is concerned
with the quiet service of building up reserves
and fortifying the body against times of
stress. Accompanying these functions are the
relatively mild pleasures of sight and taste and
smell of food. The possibility of existence of these
gentle delights of eating and drinking and also of
their physiological consequences is instantly abolished
in the presence of emotions which activate
the sympathetic division. The secretion of saliva,
gastric juice, pancreatic juice and bile is stopped,
and the motions of the stomach and intestines cease
at once, both in man and in the lower animals,
whenever pain, fear, rage, or other strong excitement
is present in the organism.</p>

<p>All these disturbances of digestion seem mere
interruptions of the “normal” course of events
unless the part they may play in adaptive reactions
is considered. In discussing the operations
of the sympathetic division, I pointed out that all
the bodily changes which occur in the intense emotional
states&mdash;such as fear and fury&mdash;occur as
results of activity in this division, and are in the
highest degree serviceable in the struggle for existence
likely to be precipitated when these emotions
are aroused. From this point of view these perturbations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>
which so readily seize and dominate
the organs that in quiet times are commonly controlled
by the cranial autonomic, are bodily reactions
which may be of the utmost importance to life
at times of critical emergency. Thus are the body’s
reserves&mdash;the stored adrenin and the accumulated
sugar&mdash;called forth for instant service; thus is the
blood shifted to nerves and muscles that may have
to bear the brunt of struggle; thus is the heart set
rapidly beating to speed the circulation; and thus,
also, are the activities of the digestive organs for
the time abolished. Just as in war between nations
the arts and industries which have brought wealth
and contentment must suffer serious neglect or be
wholly set aside both by the attacker and the attacked,
and all the supplies and energies developed
in the period of peace must be devoted to the present
conflict; so, likewise, the functions which in
quiet times establish and support the bodily reserves
are, in times of stress, instantly checked
or completely stopped, and these reserves lavishly
drawn upon to increase power in the attack and in
the defense or <span class="nowrap">flight.<a id="SNanchor_23" href="#Starnote_23" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_23" href="#SNanchor_23" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  One who permits fears, worries and anxieties to disturb
the digestive processes when there is nothing to be done, is
evidently allowing the body to go onto what we may regard
as a “war footing,” when there is no “war” to be waged, no
fighting or struggle to be engaged in.</p>
</div>

<p>It is, therefore, the natural antagonism between
these two processes in the body&mdash;between saving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span>
and expenditure, between preparation and use, between
anabolism and catabolism&mdash;and the correlated
antagonism of central innervations, that underlie
the antipathy between the emotional states
which normally accompany the processes. The
desire for food, the relish of eating it, all the
pleasures of the table, are naught in the presence
of anger or great anxiety. And of the two sorts
of emotional states, those which manifest themselves
in the dominant division of the autonomic
hold the field also in consciousness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Antagonism Between Emotions Expressed in the Sympathetic
and in the Sacral Divisions of the Autonomic
System</span></h3>

<p>The nervi erigentes are the part of the sacral
autonomic in which the peculiar excitements of
sex are expressed. As previously stated, these
nerves are opposed by branches from the sympathetic
division&mdash;the division which is operated
characteristically in the major emotions.</p>

<p>The opposition in normal individuals between the
emotional states which appear in these two antagonistic
divisions is most striking. Even in animals
as low in the scale as birds, copulation is not performed
“until every condition of circumstance and
sentiment is fulfilled, until time, place and partner
all are <span class="nowrap">fit.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> And among men the effect of fear
or momentary anxiety or any intense emotional
interest in causing inhibition of the act can be supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span>
by cases in the experience of any physician
with extensive practice. Indeed, as <span class="nowrap">Prince<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> has
stated, “the suppression of the sexual instinct by
conflict is one of the most notorious experiences
of this kind in everyday life. This instinct cannot
be excited during an attack of fear or anger, and
even during moments of its excitation, if there is
an invasion of another strong emotion the sexual
instinct at once is repressed. Under these conditions,
as with other instincts, even habitual
excitants can no longer initiate the instinctive
process.”</p>

<p>When the acme of excitement is approaching it
is probable that the sympathetic division is also
called into activity; indeed, the completion of the
process&mdash;the contractions of the seminal vesicles
and the prostate, and the subsidence of engorged
tissues, all innervated by sympathetic filaments
(see <a href=#Page_32>pp. 32</a>, 33)&mdash;may be due to the overwhelming
of sacral by sympathetic nervous discharges.
As soon as this stage is reached the original feeling
likewise has been dissipated.</p>

<p>The other parts of the sacral division which
supply the bladder and rectum are so nearly free
from any emotional tone in their normal reflex
functioning that it is unnecessary to consider them
further with reference to emotional antagonisms.
Mild affective states, such as worry and anxiety,
can, to be sure, check the activity of the colon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span>
thus cause <span class="nowrap">constipation.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> But the augmented
activity of these parts (contraction of the bladder
and rectum) in very intense periods of emotional
stress, when the sympathetic division is strongly
innervated, presents a problem of some difficulty.
Possibly in such conditions the orderliness of the
central arrangements is upset, just as it is after
tetanus toxin or strychnine poisoning, and opposed
innervations no longer discharge reciprocally, but
simultaneously, and then the stronger member of
the pair prevails. Only on such a basis, at present,
can I offer any explanation for the activity
and the supremacy of the sacral innervation of
the bladder and distal colon when the sympathetic
innervation is aroused, as, for example, in great
fright.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Function of Hunger</span></h3>

<p>A summary in few words of the chief functions
typically performed or supported by each division
of the autonomic would designate the cranial division
as the upbuilder and restorer of the organic
reserves, the sacral as the servant of racial continuity,
and the sympathetic as the preserver of the individual.
Self-preservation is primary and essential;
on that depends racial continuity, and for that
all the resources of the organism are called forth.
Analogously the sympathetic innervations, when
they meet in organs innervated also by the cranial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span>
and sacral divisions, almost without exception predominate
over their opponents. And analogously,
also, the emotional states which are manifested in
the sympathetic division and are characteristically
much more intense than those manifested in the
other divisions, readily assume ascendancy also in
consciousness.</p>

<p>It is obvious that extended action of the sympathetic
division, abolishing those influences of the
cranial division which are favorable to proper digestion
and nutrition, might defeat its own ends.
Interruption of the nutritional process for the sake
of self-preservation through defense or attack can
be only temporary; if the interruption were prolonged,
there might be serious danger to the vigor
of the organism from failure to replenish the exhausted
stores. The body does not have to depend
on the return of a banished appetite, however, before
its need for restoration is attended to. There
is a secondary and very insistent manner in which
the requirement of food is expressed, and that is
through the repeated demands of hunger.</p>

<p>Unlike many other rhythmically repeated sensations,
hunger is not one that anybody becomes accustomed
to and neglects because of its monotony.
During the period of his confinement in the citadel
of Magdeburg, the celebrated political adventurer
Baron von <span class="nowrap">Trenck<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> was allowed only a pound
and a half of ammunition bread and a jug of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>
as his daily ration. “It is impossible for me to
describe to my reader,” he wrote in his memoirs,
“the excess of tortures that during eleven months
I endured from ravenous hunger. I could easily
have devoured six pounds of bread every day; and
every twenty-four hours, after having received
and swallowed my small portion, I continued as
hungry as before I began, yet I was obliged to wait
another twenty-four hours for a new morsel....
My tortures prevented sleep, and looking
into futurity, the cruelty of my fate seemed to me,
if possible, to increase, for I imagined that the prolongation
of pangs like these was insupportable.
God preserve every honest man from sufferings
like mine! They were not to be endured by the
most obdurate villain. Many have fasted three
days, many have suffered want for a week or more,
but certainly no one besides myself ever endured
it in the same excess for eleven months; some have
supposed that to eat little might become habitual,
but I have experienced the contrary. My hunger
increased every day, and of all the trials of fortitude
my whole life has afforded, this eleven months
was the most <span class="nowrap">bitter.”<a id="SNanchor_24" href="#Starnote_24" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_24" href="#SNanchor_24" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  In all probability the continued experience of hunger
pangs reported by Baron von Trenck was due to the repeated
eating of amounts of food too small to satisfy the
bodily demand. The reader will recall that persons who for
some time take no food whatever report that the disagreeable
feelings are less intense or disappear after the third or fourth
day (see <a href=#Page_238>p. 238</a>).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span></p>

<p>Thus, although the taking of food may be set in
abeyance at times of great excitement, and the
bodily reserves fully mobilized, that phase of the
organism’s self-protecting adjustment is limited,
and then hunger asserts itself as an agency imperiously
demanding restoration of the depleted
stores.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Similarity of Visceral Effects in Different Strong
Emotions and Suggestions as to its Psychological
Significance</span></h3>

<p>The dominant emotions which we have been considering
as characteristically expressed in the
sympathetic division of the autonomic system are
fear and rage. These two emotions are not unlike.
As <span class="nowrap">James<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> has indicated, “Fear is a reaction
aroused by the same objects that arouse ferocity....
We both fear and wish to kill anything
that may kill us; and the question which of the two
impulses we shall follow is usually decided by some
one of those <em>collateral circumstances</em> of the particular
case, to be moved by which is the mark of
superior mental natures.” The cornering of an
animal when in the headlong flight of fear may
suddenly turn the fear to fury and the flight to a
fighting in which all the strength of desperation
is displayed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these dominant emotions are states
into which many other commonly milder affective
states may be suddenly transformed. As McDougall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span><a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
has pointed out, all instinctive impulses
when met with opposition or obstruction give place
to, or are complicated by, the pugnacious or combative
impulse directed against the source of the
obstruction. A dog will bristle at any attempt to
take away his food, males will fight furiously when
provoked by interference with the satisfaction of
the sexual impulse, a man will forget the conventions
and turn hot for combat when there is imputation
against his honor, and a mother all gentle
with maternal devotion is stung to quick resentment
and will make a fierce display of her combative
resources, if anyone intentionally injures
her child. In these instances of thwarted or disturbed
instinctive acts the emotional accompaniments&mdash;such
as the satisfaction of food and of
sexual affection, the feeling of self-pride, and the
tender love of a parent&mdash;are whirled suddenly into
anger. And anger in one is likely to provoke
anger or fear in the other who for the moment is
the object of the strong feeling of antagonism.
Anger is the emotion preëminently serviceable
for the display of power, and fear is often its
counterpart.</p>

<p>The visceral changes which accompany fear and
rage are the result of discharges by way of sympathetic
neurones. It will be recalled that these
neurones are arranged for diffuse rather than for
narrowly directed effects. So far as these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span>
quite different emotions are concerned, present
physiological evidence indicates that differences
in visceral <span class="nowrap">accompaniments<a id="SNanchor_25" href="#Starnote_25" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> are not noteworthy&mdash;for
example, either fear or rage stops gastric secretion
(see <a href=#Page_10>pp. 10</a>, 11). There is, indeed, obvious
reason why the visceral changes in fear and rage
should not be <em>different</em>, but rather, why they should
be <em>alike</em>. As already pointed out, these emotions
accompany organic preparations for action, and
just because the conditions which evoke them are
likely to result in flight or conflict (either one
requiring perhaps the utmost struggle), the bodily
needs in either response are precisely the same.</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_25" href="#SNanchor_25" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Obvious vascular differences, as pallor or flushing of the
face, are of little significance. With increase of blood pressure
from vasoconstriction, pallor might result from action of
the constrictors in the face, or flushing might result because
constrictors elsewhere, as, for example, in the abdomen, raised
the pressure so high that facial constrictors are overcome.
Such, apparently, is the effect of adrenin already described
(see <a href=#Page_107>p. 107</a>). Or the flushing might occur from local vasodilation.
That very different emotional states may have the same
vascular accompaniments was noted by Darwin (The Expression
of Emotions in Man and Animals, New York, 1905),
who mentioned the pallor of rage (p. 74) and also of terror
(p. 77).</p>
</div>

<p>In discussing the functioning of the sympathetic
division I pointed out that it was roused to activity
not only in fear and rage, but also in pain.
The machinery of this division likewise is operated
wholly or partially in emotions which are
usually mild&mdash;such as joy and sorrow and disgust&mdash;<em>when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span>
they become sufficiently intense</em>. Thus,
for instance, the normal course of digestion may
be stopped or quite reversed in a variety of these
emotional states.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Darwin<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span> reports the case of a young man who
on hearing that a fortune had just been left him,
became pale, then exhilarated, and after various
expressions of joyous feeling vomited the half-digested
contents of his stomach. <span class="nowrap">Müller<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> has
described the case of a young woman whose lover
had broken the engagement of marriage. She
wept in bitter sorrow for several days, and during
that time vomited whatever food she took. And
<span class="nowrap">Burton,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> in his <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>, gives
the following instance of the effect of disgust: “A
gentlewoman of the same city saw a fat hog cut
up, when the entrails were opened, and a noisome
savour offended her nose, she much misliked, and
would not longer abide; a physician in presence
told her, as that hog, so was she, full of filthy excrements,
and aggravated the matter by some
other loathsome instances, insomuch this nice gentlewoman
apprehended it so deeply that she fell
forthwith a vomiting, was so mightily distempered
in mind and body, that with all his art and persuasion,
for some months after, he could not restore
her to herself again, she could not forget or remove
the object out of her sight.”</p>

<p>In these three cases, of intense joy, intense sorrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span>
and intense disgust, the influence of the cranial
division of the autonomic has been overcome,
digestion has ceased, and the stagnant gastric
contents by reflexes in striated muscles have been
violently discharged. The extent to which under
such circumstances other effects of sympathetic
impulses may be manifested, has not, so far as I
know, been ascertained.</p>

<p>From the evidence just given it appears that
any high degree of excitement in the central nervous
system, whether felt as anger, terror, pain,
anxiety, joy, grief or deep disgust, is likely to
break over the threshold of the sympathetic division
and disturb the functions of all the organs
which that division innervates. It may be that
there is advantage in the readiness with which
these widely different emotional conditions can express
themselves in this one division, for, as has
been shown (see <a href=#Page_276>p. 276</a>), occasions may arise when
these milder emotions are suddenly transmuted
into the naturally intense types (as fright and
fury) which normally activate this division; and
if the less intense can also influence it, the physiological
aspect of the transmutation is already partially
accomplished.</p>

<p>If various strong emotions can thus be expressed
in the diffused activities of a single division of the
autonomic&mdash;the division which accelerates the
heart, inhibits the movements of the stomach and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span>
intestines, contracts the blood vessels, erects the
hairs, liberates sugar, and discharges adrenin&mdash;it
would appear that the bodily conditions which have
been assumed, by some psychologists, to distinguish
emotions from one another must be sought
for elsewhere than in the viscera. We do not “feel
sorry because we cry,” as James contended, but
we cry because when we are sorry or overjoyed or
violently angry or full of tender affection&mdash;when
any one of these diverse emotional states is present&mdash;there
are nervous discharges by sympathetic
channels to various viscera, including the lachrymal
glands. In terror and rage and intense elation,
for example, the responses in the viscera seem too
uniform to offer a satisfactory means of distinguishing
states which, in man at least, are very
different in subjective quality. For this reason I
am inclined to urge that the visceral changes merely
contribute to an emotional complex more or less
indefinite, but still pertinent, feelings of disturbance
in organs of which we are not usually conscious.</p>

<p>This view that the differential features of emotions
are not to be traced to the viscera is in accord
with the experimental results of <span class="nowrap">Sherrington,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
who has demonstrated that emotional responses
occur in dogs in which practically all the main viscera
and the great bulk of skeletal muscle have
been removed from subjection to and from influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>
upon the brain, by severance of the vagus
nerves and the spinal cord. In these animals no
alteration whatever was noticed in the occurrence,
under appropriate circumstances, of characteristic
expressions of voice and features, indicating anger,
delight or fear. The argument that these expressions
may have been previously established by afferent
impulses from excited viscera was met by
noting that a puppy only nine weeks old also continued
to exhibit the signs of emotional excitement
after the brain was disconnected from all the body
except the head and shoulders. Evidence from uniformity
of visceral response and evidence from exclusion
of the viscera are harmonious, therefore, in
minimizing visceral factors as the source of differences
in emotional <span class="nowrap">states.<a id="SNanchor_26" href="#Starnote_26" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_26" href="#SNanchor_26" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  The paucity of afferent fibres in the autonomic system,
and the probability of an extremely low degree of sensitiveness
in the viscera (for evidence, see Cannon: The Mechanical
Factors of Digestion, London, 1911, p. 202), likewise support
this conclusion.</p>
</div>

<p>If these differences are due to other than visceral
changes, why is it not always possible by voluntary
innervations to produce emotions? We can
laugh and cry and tremble. But forced laughter
does not bring happiness, nor forced sobbing sorrow,
and the trembling from cold rouses neither
anger nor fear. The muscle positions and tensions
are there, but the experiencing of such bodily
changes does not seem even approximately to rouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span>
an emotion in us. Voluntary assumption of an attitude
seems to leave out the “feeling.” It is probable,
however, that no attitude which we can assume
has all the elements in it which appear in the complete
response to a stirring situation. But is not this
because the natural response is a <em>pattern reaction</em>,
like inborn reflexes of low order, such as sneezing,
in which impulses flash through peculiarly coöperating
neurone groups of the central system,
suddenly, unexpectedly, and in a manner not exactly
reproducible by volition, and thus they throw
the skeletal muscles into peculiar attitudes and, if
sufficiently intense, rush out in diffuse discharges
that cause tremors and visceral perturbations?
The typical facial and bodily expressions, automatically
assumed in different emotions, indicate the
discharge of peculiar groupings of neurones in the
several affective states. That these responses occur
instantly and spontaneously when the appropriate
“situation,” actual or vividly imagined, is
present, shows that they are ingrained in the nervous
organization. At least one such pattern, that
of anger, persists after removal of the cerebral
hemispheres&mdash;the decorticated dog, by growling
and biting when handled, has the appearance of
being <span class="nowrap">enraged;<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span> the decerebrate cat, when vigorously
stimulated, retracts its lips and tongue,
stares with dilated pupils, snarls and snaps its
<span class="nowrap">jaws.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> On the other hand, stroking the hair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span>
whistling and gently calling to produce a pleased
attitude, or yelling to produce fright, have not the
slightest effect in evoking from the decorticated
dog signs of joy and affection or of fear, nor does
the animal manifest any sexual feeling. The absence
of bodily indications of these emotions is
quite as significant as the presence of the signs of
anger. For since expressions of anger can persist
without the cerebral cortex, there is little reason
why the complexes of other emotional expressions,
if their “machinery” exists below the cortex, should
not also be elicitable. That they are not elicitable
suggests that they require a more elaborately organized
grouping of neurones than does anger&mdash;possibly
what the cortex, or the cortex in combination
with basal ganglia, would provide.</p>

<p>The contrast between the brevity of the “pseudo-affective
reactions” in the decerebrate cat, though
the viscera are still connected with the central
nervous system, and the normal duration of emotional
expression in the dog with the body separated
from the head region, has been used by Sherrington
to weigh the importance of the visceral and
other factors. And the evidence which I have given
above, as well as that which he has offered, favors
the view that the viscera are relatively unimportant
in an emotional complex, especially in contributing
differential features.</p>

<p class="center">ALTERNATIVE SATISFACTIONS FOR THE
FIGHTING EMOTIONS</p>


<p class="sp2">The uniformity of visceral responses when almost
any feelings grow very intense, and under
such conditions the identity of these responses
with those characteristically aroused in the belligerent
emotion of anger or rage and its counterpart,
fear, offer interesting possibilities of transformation
and substitution. This is especially
true in the activities of human beings. And because
men have devised such terribly ingenious and
destructive modes of expressing these feelings in
war, an inquiry into the basis for possible substitution
seems not out of place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Support for the Militarist Estimate of the Strength of
the Fighting Emotions and Instincts</span></h3>

<p>The business of killing and of avoiding death
has been one of the primary interests of living
beings throughout their long history on the earth.
It is in the highest degree natural that feelings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>
hostility often burn with fierce intensity, and then,
with astonishing suddenness, that all the powers of
the body are called into action&mdash;for the strength
of the feelings and the quickness of the response
measure the chances of survival in a struggle
where the issue may be life or death. These are
the powerful emotions and the deeply ingrained
instinctive reactions which invariably precede combat.
They are the emotions and instincts that
sometimes seize upon individuals in groups and
spread like wildfire into larger and larger aggregations
of men, until vast populations are shouting
and clamoring for war. To whatever extent
military plans are successful in devising a vast
machine for attack or defense, the energies that
make the machine go are found, in the last analysis,
in human beings who, when the time for action
comes, are animated by these surging elemental
tendencies which assume control of their conduct
and send them madly into conflict.</p>

<p>The strength of the fighting instinct in man has
been one of the main arguments used by the militarists
in support of preparation for international
strife. They point to the historical fact that even
among highly civilized peoples scarcely a decade
passes without a kindling of the martial emotions,
which explode in actual warfare. Such fighting,
they say, is inevitable&mdash;the manifestation of
“biological law”&mdash;and, so long as human nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>
remains unchanged, decision by battle must be resorted
to. They urge, furthermore, that in war
and in the preparations for war important physical
qualities&mdash;sturdiness, hardihood, and strength
for valorous deeds&mdash;are given peculiarly favorable
opportunities for development, and that if these opportunities
are lacking, lusty youth will give place
to weaklings and mollycoddles. In addition the
militarists say that war benefits mankind by its
moral effects. Without war nations become effete,
their ideals become tarnished, the people sink into
self-indulgence, their wills weaken and soften in
luxury. War, on the contrary, disciplines character,
it sobers men, it teaches them to be brave and
patient, it renews a true order of values, and its demand
for the supreme sacrifice of life brings forth
in thousands an eager response that is the crowning
glory of the human spirit. As the inevitable
expression of a deep-rooted instinct, therefore, and
as a unique means of developing desirable physical
and moral qualities, war is claimed by the militarists
to be a natural <span class="nowrap">necessity.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The militarist contention that the fighting instinct
is firmly fixed in human nature receives
strong confirmation in the results of our researches.
Survival has been decided by the grim
law of mortal conflict, and the mechanism for rendering
the body more competent in conflict has been
revealed in earlier chapters as extraordinarily perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span>
and complete. Moreover, the physiological
provisions for fierce struggle are found not only in
the bodies of lower animals, that must hunt and
kill in order to live, but also in human beings.
Since this remarkable mechanism is present, and
through countless generations has served the fundamentally
important purpose of giving momentous
aid in the struggle for existence, the militarists
might properly argue that, as with other
physiological processes, bodily harmony would be
promoted by its exercise. Indeed, they might
account for the periodic outburst of belligerent
feelings by assuming that these natural aptitudes
require occasional <span class="nowrap">satisfaction.<a id="SNanchor_27" href="#Starnote_27" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_27" href="#SNanchor_27" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Mr. Graham Wallas has made the interesting suggestion
(The Great Society, New York, 1914, p. 66) that nervous
strain and restlessness due to “baulked disposition” may
result from the absence of circumstances which would call
the emotional responses into action. And he cites Aristotle’s
theory that pent passions may be released by represented
tragedy and by music.</p>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Growing Opposition to the Fighting Emotions and Instincts
as Displayed in War</span></h3>

<p>In spite of the teachings of history that wars
have not grown fewer, and in spite of the militarist
argument that war is a means of purging mankind
of its sordid vices, and renewing instead the noblest
virtues, the conclusion that the resort to arms
is unavoidable and desirable is nowadays being
strongly contested. The militarists show only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span>
part of the picture. No large acquaintance with
the character of warfare is necessary to prove that
when elemental anger, hate and fear prevail,
civilized conventions are abandoned and the most
savage instincts determine conduct. Homes are
looted and burned, women and children are
abominably treated, and many innocents are
murdered outright or starved to death. No bland
argument for the preservation of the manly
virtues can palliate such barbarities. Even when
fighting men are held within the rules, the devices
for killing and injuring are now made
so perfect by devilish ingenuity that by the
pulling of a trigger one man can in a few seconds
mow down scores of his fellow-creatures and send
them writhing to agony or death. War has become
too horrible; it is conducted on too stupendous a
scale of carnage and expenditure; it destroys too
many of the treasured achievements of the race; it
interferes too greatly with consecrated efforts to
benefit all mankind by discovery and invention; it
involves too much suffering among peoples not directly
concerned in the struggle; it is too vastly at
variance with the methods of fair dealing that have
been established between man and man; the human
family has become too closely knit to allow some
of its members to bring upon themselves and all
the rest poverty and distress and a long heritage
of bitter hatred and resolution to seek revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span></p>

<p>All these reasons for hostility to war imply a
thwarting of strong desires in men&mdash;desires for
family happiness, devotion to beauty and to scholarship,
passion for social justice, hopes of lessening
poverty and disease. As was pointed out in
the previous chapter, the feeling of hostility has no
definite object to awaken it. It is roused when
there is opposition to what we ardently wish to get.
And because war brings conditions which frustrate
many kinds of eagerly sought purposes, war has
roused in men a hostility against itself. There is
then a war against war, a willingness to fight
against monstrous carnage and destruction, that
grows in intensity with every war that is waged.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Desirability of Preserving the Martial Virtues</span></h3>

<p>Although there is increasing opposition to the
display of the fighting emotions and instincts in
war, nevertheless the admirable moral and physical
qualities, claimed by the militarists to be the
unique products of war, are too valuable to be lost.
As <span class="nowrap">McDougall<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> has indicated, when the life of
ideas becomes richer, and the means we take to
overcome obstructions to our efforts more refined
and complex, the instinct to fight ceases to express
itself in its crude natural manner, save when most
intensely excited, and becomes rather a source of
increased energy of action towards the end set by
any other instinct; the energy of its impulses adds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span>
itself to and reënforces that of other impulses and
so helps us to overcome our difficulties. In this
lies its great value for civilized man. A man devoid
of the pugnacious instinct would not only be
incapable of anger, but would lack this great source
of reserve energy which is called into play in most
of us by any difficulty in our path.</p>

<p>Thus the very efficiency of a war against war, as
well as struggle against other evils that beset civilized
society, rests on the preservation and use of
aggressive feeling and the instinct to attack. From
this point of view the insistence by the militarists
that we must accept human nature as we find it,
and that the attempt to change it is foolish, seems
a more justifiable attitude than that of the pacifists
who belittle the fighting qualities and urge
that changing them is a relatively simple process.
We should not wish them changed. Even if in the
war against war a means should be established of
securing international justice, and if through coöperative
action the decrees of justice were enforced,
so that the occasions which would arouse
belligerent emotions and instincts were much reduced,
there would still remain the need of recognizing
their elemental character and their possible
usefulness to society. What is needed is not a
suppression of these capacities to feel and act, but
their diversion into other channels where they may
have satisfactory expression.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Moral Substitutes for Warfare</span></h3>

<p>“We must make new energies and hardihoods
continue the manliness to which the military mind
so faithfully clings. Martial virtues must be the
enduring cement; intrepidity, contempt of softness,
surrender of private interest, obedience to
command, must still remain the rock upon which
states are built.” Thus wrote William <span class="nowrap">James<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
in proposing a “moral equivalent for war.” This,
he suggested, should consist of such required service
in the hard and difficult occupations as would
take the childishness and superciliousness out of
our youth and give them soberer ideas and healthier
sympathies with their fellow-men. He conceived
that by proper direction of its education a
people should become as proud of the attainment
by the nation of superiority in any ideal respect
as it would be if the nation were victorious in war.
“The martial type of character,” he declared, “can
be bred without war. Strenuous honor and disinterestedness
abound elsewhere. Priests and medical
men are in a fashion educated to it, and we
should all feel some degree of it imperative if we
were conscious of our work as an obligatory service
to the state. We should be <em>owned</em>, as soldiers
are by the army, and our pride would rise accordingly.
We could be poor, then, without
humiliation, as army officers now are. The only
thing needed henceforth is to inflame the civic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span>
temper as past history has inflamed the military
temper.”</p>

<p>Similar ideas have been expressed by <span class="nowrap">others.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
It has been pointed out that the great war of mankind
is that against pain, disease, poverty and sin;
that the real heroes are not those who squander human
strength and courage in fighting one another,
but those who fight for man against these his eternal
foes. War of man against man, in this view,
becomes dissension in the ranks, permitting the
common enemies to strike their most telling blows.</p>

<p>These moral considerations, however, are apart
from the main intent of our discussion. Our earlier
inquiry confirmed the belief that the fighting
emotions are firmly rooted in our natures, and
showed that these emotions are intimately associated
with provisions for physical exertion. It
is particularly in this aspect of the discussion of
substitutes for war that these studies have significance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Physical Substitutes for Warfare</span></h3>

<p>The idealization of the state and the devotion
of service to social welfare, which have been suggested
as moral substitutes for military loyalty,
leave unanswered the claims of the militarists
that in war and in preparations for war opportunities
are offered which are peculiarly favorable
to the development of important physical qualities&mdash;bodily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span>
vigor, sturdiness, and ability to withstand
all manner of hardships.</p>

<p>In the evidence previously presented, it seems
to me there was a suggestion that offers a pertinent
alternative to these claims. When the body
goes onto what we have called a war footing, the
physiological changes that suddenly occur are
all adapted to the putting forth of supreme muscular
and nervous efforts. That was what primitive
battle consisted of, through countless myriads
of generations&mdash;a fierce physical contest of beast
with beast, and of man with man. Such contests,
attended as they were by the thrill of unpredictable
incidents, and satisfying completely the lust
of combat, are to be contrasted with the dull grind
in preparation for modern war, the monotonous
regularity of subservience, the substitution everywhere
of mechanism for muscle, and often the
attack on an enemy who lies wholly <span class="nowrap">unseen.<a id="SNanchor_28" href="#Starnote_28" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span> As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
Wallas with nice irony has remarked, “The gods
in Valhalla would hardly choose the organization
of modern lines of military communication, as
they chose the play of sword and spear, to be the
most exquisite employment of eternity.”</p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_28" href="#SNanchor_28" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  Lord Wolseley, while commander-in-chief of the English
forces, in 1897, secured sanction for not displaying the regimental
colors in battle. “It would be madness and a crime,”
he declared, “to order any soldier to carry colors into action
in the future. You might quite as well order him to be assassinated.
We have had most reluctantly to abandon a
practice to which we attached great importance, and which,
under past and gone conditions of fighting, was invaluable in
keeping alive the regimental spirit upon which our British
troops depended so much.” All war has been transformed by
the invention of the far-reaching and fate-dealing rifle and
automatic gun, with which an enemy kills, whose face is not
even seen. War is almost reduced to a mechanical interchange
of volleys and salvoes, and to the intermittent fire of
rifles and machine guns, with short rushes at the last, in
which there is no place for the dignity and grace of the
antique battle of the standard. (See London Times, July 31,
1897, p. 12.)</p>

<p>T.&nbsp;F. Millard, the well-known correspondent of the Russo-Japanese
War, wrote as follows of the characteristics of
present day conflicts: “A large part of modern war is on
too great a scale to give much opportunity for individual
initiative. Soldiers can rarely tell what is going on in their
immediate vicinity. They cannot always see the enemy they
are firing at, and where they can see the object of their fire
such an important matter as range and even direction cannot
be left to them.... Troops are clothed so much alike
nowadays that it is very difficult to distinguish friend from
foe at five hundred yards, and large bodies of troops rarely
get that close to each other in modern war while there is
light enough to see clearly.... Battery officers simply see
that their guns are handled according to instructions. They
regulate the time, speed, objective and range as ordered....
The effects of the fire are observed by officers appointed to
that duty, stationed at various parts of the field, often miles
and miles apart, and who are in constant communication
with the chief of artillery by telephone.” (See Scribner’s
Magazine, 1905, <abbr title="37">xxxvii</abbr>, pp. 64, 66.)</p>

<p>The testimony of a captain of a German battery engaged
against the French and English in 1914, supports the foregoing
claims. He is reported as saying: “We shoot over those
tree tops yonder in accordance with directions for range and
distance which come from somewhere else over a field telephone,
but we never see the men at whom we are firing.
They fire back without seeing us, and sometimes their shells
fall short or go beyond us, and sometimes they fall among us
and kill and wound a few of us. Thus it goes on day after
day. I have not with my own eyes seen a Frenchman or an
Englishman unless he was a prisoner. It is not so much
pleasure&mdash;fighting like this.” (See Philadelphia Saturday
Evening Post, December 26, 1914, p. 27.)</p>
</div>

<p>While it is true that physical strength can be
developed by any form of hard labor, as, for
example, by sawing wood or digging ditches, such
labor does not stimulate quickness, alertness, and
resourcefulness in bodily action. Nor does it give
any occasion for use of the emotional mechanism
for reënforcement. If this mechanism, like other
physiological arrangements, is present in the
body for use&mdash;and previous discussion leaves little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span>
doubt of that&mdash;then as a means of exercising it
and, in addition, satisfying the strong instinct for
competitive testing of strength and physical skill,
some activity more enlivening than monotonous
gymnastics and ordered marching is required.</p>

<p>In many respects strenuous athletic rivalries
present, better than modern military service, the
conditions for which the militarists argue, the
conditions for which the body spontaneously prepares
when the passion for fighting prevails. As
explained in an earlier chapter, in competitive
sports the elemental factors are retained&mdash;man
is again pitted against man, and all the resources
of the body are summoned in the eager struggle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span>
for victory. And because, under such circumstances,
the same physiological alterations occur
that occur in anticipation of mortal combat, the
belligerent emotions and instincts, so far as their
bodily manifestations are concerned, are thereby
given complete satisfaction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Significance of International Athletic Competitions</span></h3>

<p>For reasons given above, I venture to lay emphasis
on a suggestion, which has been made
before by others, that the promotion of great international
athletic contests, such as the Olympic
games, would do for our young men much that is
now claimed as peculiar to the values of military
discipline. The substitution of athletic rivalries
for battle is not unknown. In the Philippine Islands,
according to <span class="nowrap">Worcester,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> there were no
athletics before the American occupation. The
natives soon learned games from the soldiers.
And when the sports reached such development
that competition between towns and provinces was
possible, they began to arouse the liveliest enthusiasm
among the people. The physical development
of the participants has been greatly stimulated,
the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship,
formerly lacking, has sprung into existence in
every section of the Islands, and the annual meets
between athletic teams from various provinces are
recognized as promoting a general and friendly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>
understanding among the different Filipino tribes.
The fierce Igarots of Bontoc, once constantly at
war with neighboring tribes, now show their prowess
not in head-hunting, but in baseball, wrestling,
and the <span class="nowrap">tug-of-war.<a id="SNanchor_29" href="#Starnote_29" class="snanchor">[*]</a></span></p>

<div class="starnote">
<p><a id="Starnote_29" href="#SNanchor_29" class="label"><span class="fs125">*</span></a>  It is reported that when these warriors first appeared at
the games, each brought his spear, which he drove into the
ground beside him, ready for use. As the nature of the new
rivalries became known, the spears were left behind.</p>
</div>

<p>Is it unreasonable to expect that what has happened
in the Philippine Islands might, by proper
education and suggestion, happen elsewhere in the
world? Certainly the interest in athletic contests
is no slight and transient interest. At the time
of a great war we know that news of the games
is fully as much demanded as news of the war.
Already in the United States, without special
stimulation, the number of young men engaged in
athletic training is estimated as equal to the number
in the standing army. And in England, belief
in the efficacy of athletics as a means of promoting
hardihood and readiness to face stern hazards has
found expression in the phrase that England’s
battles have been won on the football fields of
Rugby and of Eton. With the further promotion
of international contests the influence of competitive
sports is likely to increase rather than lessen.
Within national boundaries emulation is sure to
stimulate extensively such games as will bring
forth the best representative athletes that the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span>
can produce. In one of the high-spirited European
nations, which made a poor showing at the
last Olympic meet, thousands of young men began
training for the next meet, under a director imported
from the nation that had made the highest
records.</p>

<p>Training for athletic contests is quite as likely
to enure young men to physical hardship and
fatigue, is quite as conducive to the development
of bodily vigor, the attainment of alertness and
skill and the practice of self-restraint, as is army
life with its traditional associations and easy license.
It may be urged, however, that an essential
element is lacking in all this discussion&mdash;the sobering
possibility that in war the supreme surrender
of life itself may be required. Death for
one’s country is indeed glorious. But the argument
that being killed is desirable has little to
commend it. When the strongest and sturdiest are
constantly chosen to be fed to the engines of annihilation,
the race is more likely to lose greater
values than it gains from the spectacle of self-sacrifice,
however perfect that may be. Are there
not advantages in the conditions of great athletic
rivalries that may compensate for war’s most austere
demand? The race of hardy men, to secure
which the militarists urge war, is much more likely
to result from the honoring and preserving of
vigorous men in their vigor than it is from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span>
systematic selection of such men to be destroyed
in their youth.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of international games
which strongly commend them as an alternative
to the pursuit of military discipline. The high
standards of honor and fairness in sport; its unfailing
revelation of excellence without distinctions
of class, wealth, race or color; the ease with
which it becomes an expression of the natural
feelings of patriotism; the respect which victory
and pluckily borne defeat inspire in competitors
and spectators alike; the extension of acquaintance
and understanding which follows from
friendly and magnanimous rivalry among strong
men who come together from the ends of the earth&mdash;each
of these admirable features of athletic contests
between nations might be enlarged upon.
But, as intimated before, these moral considerations
must be left without further mention, as
being irrelevant to the physiological processes
with which we are dealing.</p>

<p>We are concerned with the question of exercising
the fighting instinct and thus assuring the
physical welfare of the race. The race must degenerate,
the militarists say, if this instinct is
not allowed to express itself in war. This declaration
we are in a position to deny, for the evidence
is perfectly clean-cut that the aggressive
instincts, which through æons of racial experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span>
have naturally and spontaneously developed
vigor and resourcefulness in the body, are invited
by elemental emotions, and that through these
emotions energies are released which are highly
useful to great physical effort. No stupid routine
of drill, or any other deadening procedure, will
call these energizing mechanisms into activity.
War and the preparations for war nowadays have
become too machine-like to serve as the best means
of preserving and disciplining these forces. The
exhilarating swing and tug and quick thrust of the
big limb muscles have largely vanished. Pressing
an electric contact or bending the trigger finger
is a movement altogether too trifling. If, then,
natural feelings must be expressed, if the fighting
functions of the body must be exercised,
how much better that these satisfactions be found
in natural rather than in artificial actions, how
much more reasonable that men should struggle
for victory in the ancient ways, one against another,
body and spirit, as in the great games.</p>
